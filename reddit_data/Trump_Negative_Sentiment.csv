8/15/2020,"In America at least making drugs illegal has a long story of racism. From the very beginning where lobbyists and lawmakers tried to make gross racist(against blacks and hispanics) associations with weed or cocaine. Unfortunately it worked.
  
Next was Nixon and his drug war, explicitly started to target black people and hippies.
    
Then in the 80's/90's you have Joe Biden and Strom Thurmond writing legislation that would lead to mass incarceration. Especially harming black people. Joe's 1984 bill created the 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for crack over powder cocaine. Basically destroyed many black communities.
  
That legislation wasnt rolled back until well after the damage was done.
  
Meanwhile you have private prisons, a lot of people equate to modern day slavery.

8/13/2020,"Trump's campaign has been stupid this time around.

He keeps trying to paint Joe &amp; Kamala as socialists (after all, the DNC platform is more Authleft) but the DNC specifically chose Biden and Kamala to run because their faces are relatively moderate. They can successfully appeal to both the Center-left, Center, and Center-right folks because of that, as they can grab Intersectionalists, Neolibs, Moderates and all the other voters in the middle section of the spectrum who are undecided.

Trump needs to start painting them as crooked politicians like he did Hillary and stop calling them socialists. Go after Biden working with the corrupt Obama administration, his son's dealings with Ukraine, Kamala's past as a prosecutor, etc. 

He also needs to expand his base and appeal to the moderates &amp; minority vote. Imagine if he decriminalized weed and pushed for a bill releasing all people arrested for possession.",-0.1205

And Joe is a liar who lied multiple times throughout the debates. This is a verifiable fact. Biden bringing up the cost was a disingenuous attack that Republicans use and Joe used it because he's a Republican in a blue tie.

I knew you’d come back at me with a brainwashed response. “When the cdc tells me.” The same cdc that lied about the water in Washington DC and Flint Michigan. Lol. That’s pathetic. Surgeons have been wearing masks since the 60’s to help prevent bodily fluids from dripping down into open wounds on a patient, never had anything to do with virus. People across sees where pollution is much higher and since SARS-COV-1 have been wearing masks for nearly 20 years and still all get sick. Brainwashed people like you, listen to a murdering hack stumble over his words and then lies and then back again telling you to wear a mask, when you NEVER wore one before to help protect anyone. You pretend now that you are protecting others, when of course you’re only doing it because you’re blindly led. You never cared about any sickness before, and of course, once they vaccinate you and instruct you that it’s ok to remove your mask, you won’t care then. People around you will never stop getting sick. You, being a pathetic contribution to society around you, can continue being led like a good little sheep... while real researchers and people actually trying to do good in the world pass you right up. Vaccination. COWARD. You fucking blindly ignore the amount of vaccine injuries and death every year and beg for it, not giving a shit about the people it’ll hurt this time, every few months for years to come. You cannot even name an ingredient in vaccines. You know nothing.

The saddest part of all, is that a half-face respirator will filter your breathing with a full seal around your face and nose. If anyone gave a shit about your well being at the cdc, they’d instruct you and teach you this. Filtered breathing, clean air. It still doesn’t filter out a .1 micron virus...  but at least you have you’re non-sealed non-clinical cloth mask to do that for you. So fucking ignorant to the world around him, poor poor boy.  Put on a respirator if you want to pretend to save a life dip ship. Otherwise you’re just another dumb fuck being led by corporate pharma and it’s interests.

It’s fucking hilarious you idiots make this shit political (which is all that mask is). I would not vote for Donald trump or joe Biden if they paid me a billion dollars.

*In a broadcast on Wednesday, Adams said, “Kamala Harris has no skills at all for being a politician. None. I didn’t see that coming.” Adams called it his worst prediction of all time. But there’s a catch. He believes she will still make it onto the ticket.*


*“She’s the worst candidate I’ve ever seen in my lifetime. By far, the worst,” he said. Before seeing her in public, Adams thought she had what it took to be a Democrat star. He isn’t worried about the embarrassment of being wrong in public, though. “I’ve been ashamed and embarrassed in public by my bad predictions,” he said, but pointed out it has no effect on him. Instead, Adams is doubling down on Harris being on the ticket.*


*“Let me tell you about Kamala Harris’s path to the nomination,” he said “which has just improved! She had no chance of being the one with the most support when it came to the convention.” Adams continued, “Imagine that Biden gets the nomination. As weird as it is, you can imagine it. Who does he pick for his vice president?”*


*It’s an interesting prediction. Biden does have a problem with saying racist and weird things. He is the gaffe-master. The recent ramblings about leg hair and children in a pool rubbing his legs was unarguably the worst gaffe yet. The only way Biden can appeal to anyone in his party, which claims to want diversity, is to choose a diverse running mate. “The way you balance being old and white is to have a woman or a person of color,” Adams said. “Here’s the good part: the president has to pick someone who looks less capable than him or herself.”*


*Considering that Adams thinks Harris is the worst candidate to ever be in any presidential race confirms, including “rub-my-hairy-legs” Biden, perhaps she would fit that part perfectly. “Who could Joe Biden pick that could look like that person shouldn’t have obviously been the president?” It has to be Harris, according to Adams, because of her absolute incompetence and the fact that no one can see her as president. Stranger things have happened! I’ve said from the beginning that Joe Biden is the only one who can get the nomination, so perhaps this prediction will come true.”*

- Trump with his executive order and him talking about pardoning Snowden are important, but seems to me to be pandering for votes. He could easily turn Snowden on Biden and say “Joe wrote the Patriot Act” (which he did)

8/17/2020,"per [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Accountability_and_Enhancement_Act),

It also mandated the USPS to deliver six days of the week

I'm not gonna pretend I'm an expert here, but my understanding is that pre-funding retirement benefits for half a century is insane, and something no other organization, public or private, is required to do, and this bill is near-universally accepted as the catalyst that brought the postal service to the state of precariousness it found itself in even before Trump's most recent fucking around.

However, we have to deal with the reality that we have now. Which is something that Sanders and other progressive leaders know.

Joe Biden is in support of a Public Option for health care, extending the ACA premiums, and expanding medicaid.

8/11/2020,"While I don’t think picking Harris is a disastrous choice, it’s just a cynical one. What I mean by that is it’s obvious Biden and his team chose her simply because she checks the boxes on paper: relatively young(ish), African-American, and is politically ambiguous enough to not freak out moderates nor enrage progressives. However, I’m afraid this Harris choice will do just that. 

Why Harris was so ineffective in her presidential campaign needs to be more closely examined. She failed, I believe, because she lacks a fully articulated vision of her politics/world view. She has that Machievellian characteristic that screams “will say or do anything to get elected, no matter the consequences.” Voters recognized this and rejected her for it. 

Progressives have raised legitimate concerns about her questionable prosecutorial record, and to make matters worse, she’s not exactly a “moderate” and won’t help Biden in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan (this is not to say he’ll lose them now - just that the Harris pick at best, won’t help him there. Might not tank his poll numbers there, but it won’t help). 

There’s also the matter of chemistry. Harris all but called Joe a racist on stage during the Dem debates and will now have to spend the next few months explaining why she doesn’t believe that anymore. It’s just a terrible look. 

People will see this for what it is - a “safe” choice that the beltway media will love but potentially could alienate some voters.

And you should Google bidens actual record 

Comprehensive Control Act: This 1984 law, spearheaded by Biden and Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-SC), expanded federal drug trafficking penalties and civil asset forfeiture, which allows police to seize and absorb someone’s property — whether cash, cars, guns, or something else — without proving the person is guilty of a crime.

Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986: This law, sponsored and partly written by Biden, ratcheted up penalties for drug crimes. It also created a big sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine; even though the drugs are pharmacologically similar, the law made it so someone would need to possess 100 times the amount of powder cocaine to be eligible for the same mandatory minimum sentence for crack. Since crack is more commonly used by black Americans, this sentencing disparity helped fuel big racial disparities in incarceration.

Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988: This law, co-sponsored by Biden, strengthened prison sentences for drug possession, enhanced penalties for transporting drugs, and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which coordinates and leads federal anti-drug efforts.

Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act: This 1994 law, partly written by Biden, imposed tougher sentences and increased funding for prisons, contributing to the growth of the US prison population from the 1990s through the 2000s — a trend that’s only begun to reverse in the past few years. It also included other measures, such as the Violence Against Women Act that helped crack down on domestic violence and rape, a 10-year ban on assault weapons, funding for firearm background checks, and grant programs for local and state police.",-0.1110

Yeah, the same Crime bill supported by the Congressional Black Caucus.  The same Crime bill supported by Bernie Sanders as late as 2008.

8/15/2020,"Trump has not shut down California, Newsome and some of their mayors have shut down California. I have family in California with businesses and they literally have no idea what the future is. My sister is a hair stylist and owns a salon and is now considering walking away from it because she doesn't know if she can continue paying the lease. Even when she went back to work for the two weeks they were allowed to open her days went from a six or eight-hour day to a 12-14 hour day due to the restrictions. If  you decide to do someone's hair and you get caught they'll take your license. I'm not comfortable with the government using that type of threat in order to force compliance. I understand the principle around it but it bothers me because it sets a precedent. I know several people who have caught Corona and recovered with no issues. My wife is an ER worker and has dealt with people with Corona She has a different perspective because she's seen the worst cases but the statistics don't lie when there's a clear survival rate for young people. I don't think Trump performed poorly during this pandemic. it's easy to look back and say what he should have done but whether he would have shut down a month earlier or two weeks earlier we'd still be in the same position. And the media will not give him any credit for anything unless it's negative.

8/20/2020,"Joe isn’t better, for a multitude of reasons. I’m not going to support one piece of shit just because he’s opposed to the other piece of shit. If it had been Gabbard, Sanders, or even Yang, I would have supported them. But the idea that being opposed to Trump necessitates supporting his opponent regardless of their platform is STUPID! It’s beyond idiotic, it’s historically illiterate, as that is precisely how so many despots have risen to power, by opposing what was looked on at the time to be the greater evil.

Just look at 2016. If the Democrats has put up almost literally anybody but a cold hearted bitch like Hillary, Trump would’ve been buried. This will be the second time in a row Americans are going to be faced with a decision between a turd sandwich and a giant douche, and all you’re doing is pointing out how one is bad so go for the other no matter what.

Kamala Harris is, I genuinely believe, an evil person, so even if I was going to support Biden, which I don’t because he has no consistent platform to support, I couldn’t support him knowing that there would be a good chance of Kamala taking over before the end of his first term.

All of this is besides the fact that your approach is completely irrational, that someone criticizing Biden must be in support of Trump because any vote taken away from Biden is a vote for Trump. Biden is fair game for criticism just the same as Trump is, and Biden doesn’t get a pass for the same behaviour that gets slung at Trump for. When Trump runs his mouth off and says racist crap, he should be called out on it. And so should Biden when he does so. Criticizing Biden does not make one a Trump supporter, just as criticism towards Trump doesn’t make one a Biden supporter.

Otherwise, if you think that criticism against Biden should be stifled in order to increase the chances that he wins the election, your point of view is so one sided and biased as to be worthless, and that makes you every bit as bad, contributing every bit as much towards the breakdown of society, as the diehard Trump fans who think he can do no wrong.",-0.1028

Maybe it seems naive to judge him for being bad. It’s hard to tell what percentage of people n earth, or in America are bad. Sometimes it seems like we all are. Sometimes we hear stories of generosity and accomplishment that make me feel like we’re mostly good. 

But Trump is bad. He’s a liar, an adulterer, insecure, petty. He’s just a bad person. 

I’m so tired having a bad person as president. I’m so disappointed that politics have become more important to the country than the concepts of good vs. bad.

*****

&gt; La propuesta de Donald Trump de bloquear la entrada a su país a estadounidenses y a residentes permanentes no sólo está en su mente.

&gt; Según publicó ayer 13 de agosto, la edición digital del diario The Washington Post, la idea está plasmada en un borrador.   

&gt; Donald Trump está abrumado por la crisis no esperada que la pandemia de Covid-19  le trajo y, sobre todo, porque el mal manejo de la misma será convertido en un arsenal electoral en manos del próximo candidato demócrata a la presidencia, Joe Biden.   

&gt; Funcionarios que conocen del tema aseguran que Trump quiere detener la propagación del virus a través de frenar el paso de miles de cruces al día de ciudadanos estadounidenses y personas que tienen la green card, muchos de los cuales residen en México y trabajan en Estados Unidos.   

&gt; Un funcionario entrevistado por The Washington Post subestimó la intención del presidente al comparar la posible medida con una petición de evitar los viajes por cuestiones de la pandemia.

Kamala is not good

“Harris’s attorney general office did block DNA testing that some legal observers believe could have helped overturn the murder conviction of a death row inmate who has insisted he was framed.

Harris opposed efforts by lawyers for Kevin Cooper, a death row inmate from San Bernardino County, to get new DNA testing. In 2018, following a New York Times investigation into the case, Harris said she was wrong and called for further testing. Gov. Jerry Brown and his successor, Gavin Newsom, ordered additional testing to take place, which is still ongoing.

Her attorneys also defended several other convictions with serious problems. In one case, her office defended a murder conviction in which a prosecutor allowed false testimony in court. That provoked harsh criticism of her office from a federal appeals court panel, and Harris later changed her position, arguing for the conviction to be reversed.”

8/20/2020,"As we’ve detailed over the past several weeks, Donald Trump is a disaster in multiple ways — from poorly thought out policy ideas to bargain-basement ethics to his racism and sexism and divisiveness. Today’s reason in our list of 99 of them for denying Trump a second term highlights two moments when his awful attributes merged into an especially toxic brew.

One year ago, Trump was embroiled in a nutty international incident by floating the idea of purchasing Greenland, adding the world’s biggest island to America’s global footprint. Mette Frederiksen, prime minister of Denmark (which provides Greenland with two-thirds of its operating budget), correctly and candidly called the idea “absurd.”

ADVERTISEMENT

That earned her a “nasty” rebuke, one of Trump’s favorite insults to deliver to women. In a typical huff, Trump then canceled a trip to Denmark.

Meanwhile, Miles Taylor, the former Trump Department of Homeland Security chief of staff who endorsed Joe Biden this week, revealed that Trump disclosed that, if he had his preference, he’d sell Puerto Rico while acquiring Greenland; Trump deemed Puerto Rico “dirty,” saying “the people are poor.” Puerto Ricans, of course, are American citizens.

This isn’t a coincidence. In January 2018, Trump was overheard musing that he wanted more immigration from Norway and less from what he called “shithole countries” like Haiti and various African nations.

The demographics of the types of people Trump wants coming to America and those he would limit is no coincidence. The consequence is a dark stain on America’s spirit that must be cleaned on Nov. 3",-0.0973

8/15/2020,"You're the one who is arguing that suspicion equals guilt. There is a video of Joe Biden bragging about threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine unless a prosecutor was fired. There is also an audio recording of Biden talking with the president of Ukraine confirming that the prosecutor was fired, then Biden says he'll release the aid money. Which is the exact thing that the Democrats tried to impeach Trump over. Along with you stating that you're fine with the FBI using corrupt methods to incriminate people that the president ordered to be prosecuted, even after that citizen was cleared of wrongdoing by the same federal organization that the president ordered to find anything that would remove Flynn from the Trump administration. Not to mention the fact that the article we're having this debate on is about how the FBI fabricated evidence to go forth with the Russia investigation even though there was no evidence to support that claim. It's truly ironic that you're saying I'm putting party in front of country. When you are purposely ignoring the insanely suspicious activities of the party that you support.

8/12/2020,"&gt; I am cognizant that you did not respond about which subsidies you'd had in mind when you posted upthread

The ACA provides subsidies to about 5-10% of the population. The plans are mostly crap but slightly less crap than what self employed people had before. 

Pelosi's bill she wants to get through now has apparently 60 billion in food subsidies for the poor. My original response was that if she supported M4A, the average American would be saving $5000 a year in healthcare costs, and that's a lot more food ultimately.  But food subsidies don't challenge any powerful corporations. M4A does. 

Here is $40 billion for Pell Grants for instance:

https://www.campusexplorer.com/college-advice-tips/CE18C8D1/President-Obama-Increases-Pell-Grant-Awards/

Of course, on education we find that Dems will throw 40 billion at working class children but at the same time Biden will aid the student loan crisis in order to help banks:

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/joe-biden-student-loan-debt-2005-act-2020

It's worth noting that a majority of Dem senators opposed this. But ultimately that's meaningless as enough Dems supported it to pass. And the rest just didn't have to or weren't bribed enough or forced to by the banking system. 

So that's just a couple of examples where Dems will throw some subsidies to the poor but really only to slightly address the problems they helped create.",-0.0890

Maybe we can’t say for sure that she doesn’t look down on him for what he did, but we also can’t say the opposite, yet you’re here defending an article that does. I’m more keen to believe that she did give him a pass, because why wouldn’t she? Yeah what he did was inappropriate and he made people uncomfortable but as far as harassment goes, it’s not really that bad. We have no reason to believe he did it because he wanted to fuck someone, nor did he do it to abuse a power dynamic, or extort someone, or anything. He’s an old man that gives women a kiss to say hi and sometimes makes people uncomfortable, that’s so common it’s literally a trope in media.

Qanon belief: DJT is actually a savant genius fighing the deep state cabal of criminal child abusers and waging a secret war against corruption. 

Facts: in 4 years of office has made some of the most ridiculous claims (let alone his random comments on stuff) from windmills causing cancer, to him being able to end the AIDS epidemic and cure childhood cancer if re-elected, to Joe Biden wanting to destroy God and the Bible. 

So, let me get this straight, he wants people to believe that scientists who have been working for decades to cure these horrible diseases are going to be able to, with NO additional funding spoken of, miraculously just find cures for these diseases. Wow. 

Climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese to destroy the US economy. 97% of the world's scientific community says, aaaahh, no. 

I don't know what exactly he thinks Joe Biden plans to do with God or the Bible, but I *do* know this: I watched him deliver a desperate, incoherent speech this morning during which he went  off on a tangent about sharks. He's a baby-brained man-child mummy's boy. 

Anyone who thinks he's anything else, other than what you see, is kidding themselves. It's never too late to admit that you were wrong about him. Everyone was sold a lie, not just you. He's not only single-handedly ruined the progress and international reputation of the US in four short years, but probably set the GOP back decades. Can you imagine *ever* voting for that party for the rest of your life for fear that you'd end up with another f\\*cking chimp like DJT.  How would you ever trust a party that stands behind an incompetent compulsive liar like him?

IMO the day he retweeted support for the alien sperm doctor they should have slapped him with the 25th amendment and removed him. Qanon would have spun it like they always do. Like Russia collusion, impeachment and everything else it'd be a 'hoax'. 

Funny that AG Bill Barr is his little bitch now (I thought the job of AG was to be the senior legal person for the people) acting as DJT's personal PI looking into the FBI's conduct during the DJT campaign in 2016. Qanon f\\*ckbags are waiting with baited breath and hoping that this is the one that sees Obama and Biden and co 'brought to justice' finally. Nope, but what *has* happened, is that Steve Bannon (yet another DJT cronie, former adviser) has been arrested on charges of fraud. 

Keep hoping and praying you Qanon chimps. It's never gonna happen because there *is* no storm (aside from the one going on in your head).

If you are a progressive and you hate to see the rise of fascism we need to buckle up, raise money for AOC and support ole Joe at least for 3 more months. After that you can go back to shitting on the dems just like they deserve to be shit on. But we need a democracy to exist to shit on them.

8/15/2020,"Because you're not doing anything he doesn't like. Plenty of Germans didn't have their lives unduly disrupted by the Nazis. Trump tear gassed peaceful protestors for a photo OP. Sent DHS goons to pull people into unmarked vans. 

Trump is a sociopath with no respect for the rule of law or the constitution. He only follows it when it suits his purposes. He tells states they're on their own with Covid, which, if you're a federalist, yay for that. But then when it comes to protests and riots that put FAR fewer peoples lives in danger, oh suddenly we need a federal response. Fucking spare me. He's bypassing the constitution even now by literally legislating with his executive orders. 

Every good thing he's done is completely self-serving. And he's done some good things like the prescription drug thing and the deal between Israel and the UAE, and trying to pull out of Afghanistan. But to me, the bad outweighs the good. Sorry.

And I'm not afraid of any other Republican btw. Just him. If he croaked tomorrow and Mike Pence became president, Mike Pence would have my vote over Sleepy Joe and Kopmala.

Just because I hate trump doesn't mean I love democrats. Trump only has the ability to do what he's doing because of the last 20 years of bipartisan terrorism paranoia that gave the executive branch those powers to begin with. The DHS and TSA shouldn't even fucking exist, but here we are, because fucking Feinstein and Biden and half the DNC let Bush ass rape Congress after 9/11.

Joe might not have directly done so, but this sentiment was implied through those who spoke before and after him who went on and on about the ole’ corn on the cob. The Biden campaign is adopting Hillary’s strategy, even if they do not do so explicitly. They’re abandoning all of their selling points in favor of sappy displays of emotion and “Trump is worse than Biden so vote Biden”. The public option, an idea that Biden ran on for a large part of his fucking campaign, was only mentioned once.

8/18/2020,"&gt;What makes this question harder for you to answer than the other questions about support for Biden?

Because the question you asked me has a prerequisite attached to it: being black.  

I can't answer a question that's about the opinions of how black people think about an issue without being black myself. 

&gt;Also, if his record for that community is as bad as it's made out, why would Obama have chosen him as a running mate? What would have made Biden uniquely qualified for that position over all the other objections, such that no better option was available?

I'm not sure what opinion you hold Barack Obama to in your mental image of him, but he wasn't some anti-authoritarian figure like revisionist historians on Reddit paint him to be. He was constantly getting us into military conflicts we had no business being in, without the approval of congress.

The same question can be asked why Joe Biden would be tone deaf enough to pick Kamala Harris as his VP curing a state of civil unrest over police.",-0.0868
8/17/2020,I hate politics now for this reason: Joe says something very nice to Trump on Twitter. He responds basically by retweeting a video of Biden unable to talk correctly.

8/14/2020,"So linking a bad, racist, sexist YouTube channel is obviously a misstep huh? The United States is so extremely conservative that if I were to hold values similar to the Republican Party in my country, I would be labelled as a Nationalist, Racist, Sexist that could not be helped. Linking an alt-right YouTube channel does not indicate development, or diversification, politically.

PragerU denies that the Republicans are further to the right of the Democrats citing of 'historical events', like how Lincoln, a Republican was the one who abolished slavery. This implies that they do not believe in the party switch. I'm not going to listen to a source that is as infactual and wrong as that.

I value egalitarian values, so I am inherently as socialist (left-winger), I'm sorry if you believe Universal Healthcare is impossible because you've been fed false information. I'm sorry that you believe that firearms are the way forward. I'm sorry that you believe that the United States is the most developed country on the planet, despite corruption, an ineffective democratic system, and a lack of a left-wing. Bernie Sanders would be considered a Centrist overseas, and Joe Biden and Donald Trump are about as far right as each other, with Biden just being a little less authoritarian. They both comfortably fit into the auth-right square.

I'm happy to continue, but I don't think I need to explain more about how fucked the US is, or how much of a massive joke PragerU is, I mean they say sexist shit all the time.",-0.0866

8/14/2020,"Well from a purely objective perspective, this stands almost no chance at all of convincing anyone that he’s right. It only serves to make people who already agree with him to feel better about themselves.

I disagree with him and probably still would even if he’d made a decent pitch, but it’s just so obvious to me how ineffective this screeching and vote shaming will be on anyone.

As far as the topic at hand goes, Vaush seems like an idiot to me if he really can’t understand that Twitter is a venue people use to vent their frustrations at political figures and that people tweeting that they’re disappointed in Bernie are not doing shit to effect the Leftist movement one way or the other.

In addition, Vaush’s idea of just “bending the knee” to the fucking demonic ruling class is utterly pathetic. When actual politicians like Nina Turner and Rashida Tlaib are making stronger statements against Joe Biden than an edgelord YouTuber like Vaush, it’s a really bad sign about his idea of how politics work. He comes off as way too into the idea of abandoning our beliefs for political expediency when he isn’t even in a position where an idea like that is useful to him. He should be fucking honest with people about how awful Biden is and stop trying to play 4D chess about when it will be okay to tell the truth.",-0.0864

Joe Biden was never a consideration for me as far as POTUS is concerned.

Yes: Joe Biden is a piece of shit conservative with oatmeal for brains who doesn't know what he's running for, he chose a fucking **prosecutor** to be his running mate in a time of extreme anti-cop sentiment. Being angry over that is leftist tears to you? You sound like you're drunk.

I understand that there's this desire to minimize people into falling in line because you're angry that they don't see things the same way as you do, but denying the truth about Biden and the state of this country because you're frightened of Trump is devoted weakness and ignorance. More the point it doesn't *work* because the very people you're calling childish will simply see you as a tool that they don't wanna associate with, in addition to having to swallow down the biden-vomit. Why do you Democrats make it so hard to vote for your candidates?

But the magnitude of it is incredibly overblown. And now I have Joe Biden telling me that me and all my black people don't have diverse goals or ideas. It's honestly depressing how bad the political game has gotten when all I've heard are complaints nonstop for the past 4 years and Biden (and the real future president) is all they could come up with.

It's crazy how worked up they are that Biden initially said he'd pick a woman.

I just have to say, that as a black woman, and millennial, the way that some younger people (gen Z or whatever you call them) have tried to make this election about Biden “not giving them something to vote for” is such bullshit.

There was a post two days ago about Gen-Z and their non-voting bexcuses. And some assholes where trying to defend this idea that “We need something to vote for”. I hope to God that those were just Russian or Chinese trolls, because if you are young person and especially a young black person who is pushing this “Joe Biden is a boring choice and blah blah fucking blah Democrats are not doing enough to be progressive...” then I wish nothing but the worst for you.

If you are black or brown in America, you cannot afford to, “not care”, about elections.

If you are those assholes that are blaming Democrats for “not giving you something to vote for”: 

You clearly have no respect for those of us out here who killing it every day, sucking up the racism and sexism that we face while trying to improve our social and economic status. 

You have no respect for the black/brown women and men who have taken on huge amounts of student debt to get a BA or MA and qualify for jobs that are high paying, well funded, and long lasting.

You have no respect for black ancestors who literally bled not only across this nation but across the globe for young black folks to sit behind their Instagram pages clicking that Goddamn heart button every time they see a BLM post.

You have no respect for yourself. 

You would rather sit dumbly repeating some mantra you read on Twitter and watch this world burn just because you *think* you have nothing left to lose. If DT is reelected because you choose not to vote or choose to vote against Biden, you are openly choosing the side of racism and fascism— and I have no sympathy for you when you finally realize your mistake.

**Article**:

&gt; President Trump lashed out at Michael Bloomberg on Thursday after the former New York City mayor delivered a scorching assessment of Trump’s tenure in the White House during a speech to the Democratic National Convention. 

&gt; In a tweet, Trump lambasted Bloomberg’s widely panned performance in a February debate during his short-lived bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and accused the former mayor of trying to stage a political “comeback” with his convention speech. 

&gt; “After the worst debate performance in the history of politics, Michael Bloomberg, commonly known as Mini Mike, is trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance,” Trump tweeted minutes after Bloomberg’s speech aired. “They treated him like a dog – and always will. Before politics, he said GREAT things about me!”

&gt; After the worst debate performance in the history of politics, Michael Bloomberg, commonly known as Mini Mike, is trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance. They treated him like a dog - and always will. Before politics, he said GREAT things about me!

&gt; Bloomberg offered a scathing critique of Trump’s presidency and business record during his convention speech on Thursday night, saying that the president had “failed the American people catastrophically.”

&gt; “Four years ago, I came before this very convention and said New Yorkers know a con when we see one,” Bloomberg said. “But tonight I’m not asking you to vote against Trump because he’s a bad guy. I’m urging you to vote against him because he’s done a bad job.”

&gt; Bloomberg’s speech came on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, moments before former Vice President Joe Biden formally accepted the party’s presidential nomination and kicked off his general election campaign against Trump.

&gt;I can find senior advisers. But who cares.

Because I think this is a silly argument and I don't wanna go down that road. But I can provide the evidence. It's just not relevant to the topic. By the way I already did. General Flynn.

&gt;Is that the anti anti-intellectual method of reasoning? Who cares? I care, because we are making a 1-to-1 comparison, which you claim you are capable of doing, but don't support your claims with evidence. Why are you unwilling to support your beliefs with facts?

Because it's irrelevant and that's the basis of my argument as to the relevance of Republicans who don't like Donald Trump. It goes exactly to the point. Therefore naming Democrats who don't like Joe Biden would be committing the same error. It was a throwaway point. I can name some Democrats who hate Joe Biden. But what difference does it make? It wasn't relevant to my argument at all.

&gt;  
Why do you think so many of the people Trump trusted to be in his administration have now publicly denounced him? Why is this not the case for other presidents? (unless of course you have EVIDENCE that this is typical of other presidencies?)  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is Miles Taylor not a freethinker? If he went from a member of Trump's administration to an opponent of it, wouldn't that suggest he is capable of thinking differently from the group he is surrounded by?

GroupThink. Stupidity. Being afraid to be criticized in the press. Swamp creatures attacking them and possibly threatening arrest. I don't know why it's not the case for the presidents.

8/18/2020,"&gt;Trump Is Having a Full-Blown Temper Tantrum Over Michelle Obama  
Eric Lutz  
5-6 minutes  
Much ado was made, in 2016, about the supposed genius of the nicknames with which Donald Trump branded his opponents. Lyin’ Ted. Little Marco. Crooked Hillary. To some observers, these insults, however childish, stuck because they managed to capture something essential about their targets or the way that they were perceived. Through some combination of canny marketing or accidental savvy, the theory went, he was able to latch onto his opponents’ fatal flaw, like a bully seizing on his victim’s defining insecurity. But, like most of the skills attributed to Trump, this talent was grossly overstated: His digs have always been one-note, too broad, and his attempts at incisive monikers for Joe Biden in 2020 have failed to register. The magic isn’t gone—it was never there to begin with.  
  
&gt;What does it really look like to expose a politician for who they are? It was Michelle Obama on Monday night, speaking at the virtual Democratic National Convention. Of course, she didn’t hurl puerile insults at the president—she didn’t need to. But she also didn’t need any rhetorical flourishes to lacerate him—no jokey jabs, no grand metaphors. All she needed was five simple words, words the president himself had used just this month to describe the rising COVID death toll : “It is what it is.”  
  
&gt;For all his autocratic aspirations, Trump is no political wizard. He is, as Obama nailed him in her incisive, effortless takedown, a fraud, an incompetent in completely over his head, degrading the national discourse and flexing authoritarian muscles not because he’s an evil genius, but because he’s so thoroughly inadequate, so “unable to meet the moment,” that those strongman tactics are all he’s got. “He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us,” she said in her rousing address Monday. “It is what it is.”  
  
&gt;The searing speech clearly struck a nerve with the president, who rattled off a series of desperate rebuttals against the former first lady and Barack Obama, one of the headliners for Wednesday’s DNC programming.  
  
&gt;In one tweet, he asked that somebody “explain to [Obama] that Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama.” In another, he attempted to ding his predecessor and Joe Biden over their “weak and pathetic” response to the H1N1 flu, which left roughly 12,000 Americans dead, as opposed to the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 170,000 Americans and counting. In another still, Trump made some familiar noises about supposed Obama administration corruption, deep state figures spying on his campaign, and treason, before somewhat incomprehensibly thanking Michelle Obama for her “very kind words.” In an appearance at the White House later Tuesday morning, he lashed out again, saying she was “in over her head” and criticizing her for pre-recording the speech, noting that she had “the wrong [coronavirus] deaths”—calling attention to the fact that the death count is now far higher than it was when she taped her address.  
  
&gt;These frenzied retorts, though, only proved the former first lady’s point — that this is a man who just simply does not have it. As the New Yorker’s Emily Nussbaum pointed out Tuesday, that observation, however obvious it may seem, is perhaps a more damaging indictment than any that focuses on his sadism. That cruelty is a defining feature, and likely a draw for his supporters. Trump may be brutal, but it’s targeted at those his base considers enemies. In correctly observing that there’s nothing else behind that meanness—no substance or grand plan or basic competence, just emptiness and neediness and pettiness—Obama takes all the air out of him. “One of the smartest aspects of [Obama’s] speech is that instead of denouncing him as evil, she correctly nailed him as weak &amp; incompetent, ill-prepared for the job, an insecure fake,” Nussbaum observed on Twitter. “Much more damning—&amp; accurate, especially on COVID.”  
  
&gt;Obama on Monday distilled Trump to his essence in a way he has never quite been able to with his rivals. That much became clear after the DNC’s first night, when the president’s campaign released an email to supporters mocking other speakers who shared “FAKE NEWS” about him with lame little monikers: Bernie Sanders was “crazy,” Amy Klobuchar was a “failed presidential candidate,” Andrew Cuomo was “Fredo’s brother,” and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was “‘Half’ Whitmer.” The only speaker the campaign denounced without a derisive nickname?

It also created a big sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine; even though the drugs are pharmacologically similar, the law made it so someone would need to possess 100 times the amount of powder cocaine to be eligible for the same mandatory minimum sentence for crack. Since crack is more commonly used by black Americans, this sentencing disparity helped fuel big racial disparities in incarceration.

Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988: This law, co-sponsored by Biden, strengthened prison sentences for drug possession, enhanced penalties for transporting drugs, and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which coordinates and leads federal anti-drug efforts.

Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act: This 1994 law, partly written by Biden, imposed tougher sentences and increased funding for prisons, contributing to the growth of the US prison population from the 1990s through the 2000s — a trend that’s only begun to reverse in the past few years. It also included other measures, such as the Violence Against Women Act that helped crack down on domestic violence and rape, a 10-year ban on assault weapons, funding for firearm background checks, and grant programs for local and state police.

My point was that for all intents and purposes Joe Biden and the democrats have been very respectful of the situation, something that Trump would not have done were the roles reversed. 

Oh boo hoo, that’s a shit argument and you know it. Trump legitimately meant that, the asshole has been sending secret police to beat and intimidate protesters and has often talked about how much he wants to jail his political opponents whether they’ve done something illegal or not. The fact that Trump’s brother has passed doesn’t change the fact that Trump is a massive piece of shit who has done nothing in his presidency to help the people of the US.

It's almost like we have a government set up so that this does not happen. Guess you missed all the times he has tried to seize more power to him.

\\&gt; He deliberately says that shit to rile up his base and fuck with your heads and Democrats let him live in their brains rent free. 

Or he is just not good at keeping his mouth shut. Your Trump supporter is showing.

\\&gt; The guy is a compulsive liar yet on this point the Democrats believe him 100% at his word. 

You need to proofread your comments, it's the other way around. Of course they shouldn't believe him, he lies all of the fucking time.

\\&gt; At the same time the Democrats basically call him senile and a retard  they’re also trying to convince people that he’s going to successfully  mastermind a coup d’état of the government. 

Another Trump supporter argument. Or they think he is a stupid old racist that realizes he can easily overreach the power of the presidency.

\\&gt; It’s cognitive dissonance. Pick a fucking narrative. 

Quick tip, don't just yell out random terms if you don't know what they mean. Imagine thinking that being stupid and a wannabe dictator are mutually exclusive. LMFAO

\\&gt; Calling Trump a dictator is a deliberate attempt to deflect from the Democrats own weaknesses as a party. 

I actually see liberals and some progressives saying it. This argument is a very sad one. The democratic party is weak, but the ones in it are not even calling him a dictator. People all across the spectrum are calling him out though.

\\&gt; They need him to be the ultimate evil so they can sucker the masses into accepting their lighter version of evil. 

This is actually correct. Why didn't you just say this instead of the other idiocy?

\\&gt; You call me a Trump defender yet I’ve called him a fucktard on this sub  multiple times and I even told you that I would be glad donate to your  kickstarter to fund his assassination. 

And yet here you are defending him.

\\&gt;  Just like the way Trump is painted as Satan, 

Holy fucking shit, not even one sentence later. Now that is actual cognitive dissonance.

\\&gt; you need to tell yourself that independent progressives are Trump  supporters because you can’t handle the reality that we were never  democrats to begin with and we hate both of your stupid fucking parties. 

I'm an actual progressive, not a pretend one like you. We don't defend Trump like you. I am against both parties, I just like to address reality. Try it sometime.

\\&gt; You’ve admitted that two party system is evil and your response is to endorse it. 

LMFAO!!!!! When did I endorse it? Show me exactly where. I just know that a third party is not going to come along within the next few months. You seem to be having trouble with that simple reality. One will be president regardless if a couple of people sit at home pouting.

\\&gt; All you’ve done is assign fixing it into the too hard basket and accepted the status quo. 

And what are you doing to make sure that the status quo is annihilated? What i am doing is making sure my enemy is as weak as possible.

\\&gt; You’re a real hero. 

Oh, thank you. It means a lot.

\\&gt; In four years you’ll be pushing the same crap about falling into line with the Democrats as a strategic choice 

It depends. I will spend the next four years advocating for change and doing my part. If it ends up that not enough change happens then whoever I see that will do the least amount of damage is who I will vote for since, like I said before, sitting at home pouting definitely does not make the slightest bit of difference.

\\&gt;when, just like every other time they’ve had power, they’ll have made  zero changes to fix the system because they don’t want to risk  disrupting the duopoly.  

Yep, they do. And Republicans keep trying to make it so that it is a monopoly. How convenient that you left that out.

\\&gt; You can do whatever the fuck you want with your vote but don’t expect  people to buy your brand of bullshit when you know you’re selling  bullshit. 

Making sure that the least amount of people are harmed in the next four years is bullshit? Hmmm, you are really showing your true colors here aren't you?

\\&gt;  I’ve seen your other posts pushing Biden. 

Ewww, stalker much?

\\&gt;  I don’t care if Bernie approves of Biden or if he’s voting for Biden strategically, he can do whatever he wants. 

And yet you seem to have a problem with people voting for whoever they want. Unlike you, Bernie actually cares.

\\&gt;  Vote blue no matter who without any questions is a Democrat cult mantra that independents have no obligation to subscribe to. 

You act like this whole conversation was about independents and by extension, you. Stop being such an egotist.

\\&gt; I never said I wasn’t voting you just assumed that. 

It's almost like its conversation was not about just me or you. you have to think bigger, it's not always about you.

\\&gt; I’m just not voting for the person you want me to vote for or Trump. 

Ok, good. Voting is and always should be a right. I will always tell people to vote for who they think should be president. i just hope you can live with your choice.

\\&gt; You care about what I think of this election, just like you care about what others on here think of it. 

It's a fact that you do. You have spent a good bit of time typing out these replies and you even said that you were voting, again, cognitive dissonance. 

\\&gt; You’re just once again deluding yourself. 

I like how you didn't even explain how, oh well, this is not about me.

\\&gt; If you truly didn’t care you’d just stay away without a passing thought  but instead you’ll be back again and again and again proselytising for  the Democrats.

I don't remember saying that I did not care about the election. Sounds like a strawman to me. Well I am just trying to convert them to their vote, not every view they have. How convenient that you left that part out as well.

Biden is not a candidate that makes a lot of people go 'yes we can', but on the flip side, he is no clinton who makes them go 'I VOTE THIRD'.
Trump on the other hand has a very real problem, because even chunks of the reps find him unfavorable (more than dems find biden unfavorable) and lots of antitrumpers will vote biden just against trump.

Is is not 2016, as i said, trump's slogans are old. he has a base, but that base is not insanely huge.

Biden is probably the candidate closest to moderate reps that the dems had to offer. Swingvoters who dont like democrats but hate trump can vote for Biden because he doesnt talk about defunding the police or breaking up facebook or a wealth tax.

Also, Harris never had abysmal polls. She was at 15% at a time and then her campaign fizzled out and she closed it off at 5% polling.
You know who else had 5% in the primary polls?
Joe Biden, when he ran against Clinton and Obama in 2008, then became vice president and was a really effective help for Obama when he ran.

I get it’s hard to think that way but these people mostly have little or no education, they grew up being fed the wrong mentality and bs information. They have literally been fucked by the system and fed horse shit their whole lives so when you call them stupid or selfish there is no way they will hear that and a light goes off and all of a sudden they realize the error in their ways. And the “how can accommodate you?” And staying “calm” is only half the battle. You have to talk to these people (and anyone who is pissed off really) kind of like they are young children because they are acting like young children. Just imagine a 4 year old banging their head on the ground because they can’t have more ice cream. You say shit like, “I know buddy/sweetie but you just can’t do/have X. I know it’s shitty buts it’s not the end of the world.” Blah blah blah and if you absolutely have to just ignore them. These people getting arrested are an example of when you had a friend in middle school say something that’s wrong and someone says “that’s not true you idiot” and then they double down. Except as an adult doubling down gets you sent to prison. For example if you thought X was true and your buddy found out would you prefer they say “you fucking dip shit how could you think that X is true?? Oh my god u/bloodjunkiorgy is a fucking retard hahaha let me film them being wrong.” Or “oh dude, no that’s not true at all. Here let me show you that it’s not true? Why did you think that was true? Oh your dad told you that? No big deal!”? I know you’d like to believe that the second option is how we have been approaching it but understandably our patience is running low 12 years into this kind of bullshit that it’s hard. If you are truly on the right side of an issue you will never have to resort to being a cunt to someone. Look at the civil rights movement for Pete’s sake. Black Americans not only got screamed and yelled at they got beat up, killed, arrested, spit on, young, old, man, women. And did Martin Luther King Jr. ever give a speech that said “you fucking idiots LMAO we are people too hahaha look at how stupid you are for being racist?” Not once. He may have thought it and the movement started a monumental reversal of 400 years of bias. People only respond to kindness regardless of if you want to believe it or not. The shittier we are to these sad people the shittier they are going to act. They think they are at “war” because that’s what they have been told so if you fight with them that fuels the mindset. If they find themselves fighting against no one and no thing then all of a sudden that mindset seems to make less and less sense. And these folks are DENSE so it may take time especially after how heated this whole thing has gotten over the years. If trump loses it’s not time for revenge it’s not time to bully them it’s time to move on and show them through actions that our side is the side you should want to be on. We can’t forget these people we have to bring them with us to the other side. Joe Biden winning will not make this any better if the “battle” wages on. I know it’s hard, believe me.

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate shows Biden doubling down on his long history of excessive law enforcement and support for the war on drugs. 
In a year of national uprising against police violence, Kamala Harris who spent 25 years in law enforcement is an ironic selection. Her campaign for president ended quickly as she dropped out of the race two months before the Iowa Caucus and three days before the filing deadline to be on the ballot in her home state of California, where she was behind in the polls. Part of her decline was caused by voter dismay at her reversal on Medicare For All, when she flip-flopped to a policy that subsidized private health insurance and misleadingly continued to call it Medicare for All.
While Joe Biden was the principal legislative architect of the drug war and mass incarceration from his time on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Harris’s record as a prosecutor and Attorney General was as a foot soldier in the drug war and mass incarceration. As the San Francisco  District Attorney drug-related prosecutions increased from 56 percent in 2003 to 74 percent in 2006. In 2019, she admitted smoking marijuana in college but while Attorney General of California from 2011-2017, Harris sent at least 1,560 people to prison over marijuana-related offenses. In 2014, a week after the New York Times called for legal marijuana, Harris laughed when asked if she supported it. Now, she supports ending federal laws against marijuana, a position not held by Biden.
While Biden sponsored mandatory sentencing, Harris defended one of the worst mandatory sentencing laws in the US, California’s ‘three strikes law’ that also applied to “minor” felonies. She campaigned against a voter initiative that would have reformed this to require serious or violent felonies for life sentences. Harris did not take a position on two ballot initiatives in 2012 and 2014 that would have reduced punishment for low-level crimes and given judges more flexibility at sentencing. Both initiatives passed without her support.
After the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, police accountability was on the agenda in the California legislature. Harris refused to take a position on racial profiling by police. As Attorney General she refused to investigate highly questionable police shootings in Los Angeles 2014 and in San Francisco in 2015.",-0.0678

the NAACP being in opposition like that indicates an extreme conterversy.

8/12/2020,"It’s disgusting the way they say it, really.

There are real **people** who are hunted down, raped, tortured, and murdered by **real** fascism:  In Germany, in Austria, in Poland, in Romania, in Italy, in so many other places .. and later in South Africa.

So many people have been utterly destroyed and tormented, their children killed in front of their eyes as they shrieked in horror.

To take all of that and world the word “fascist” like a clumsy toy.  To whip that word around because “I don’t like Orange Man!” -  it’s a disgusting act of unearned self pity, a clumsy weapon fabricated on the blood and bones of real victims.  It’s disgusting, vile, and self-serving.  But they joyously do it anyway.

They don’t believe it when they say it.  They just think all those millions who suffered don’t count.  They shit on those people’s collective graves.  It makes me want to puke.

— “Oh wait!” you might ask “Did you just say they don’t even believe it when they say it?!”

Yep, and I can prove it:

If they truly believe it fascism had arrived with Donald J Trump, but they have to now openly say Fascism is just around the corner in this country. Fascism could happen at any moment. That we must be vigilant against the possibility that real life 100% pure fascism to come to the red states at the drop of a hat.

So ... why aren’t they **ARMING THEMSELVES?**

If they sincerely believe what they’re saying, even if it’s just in vague overarching terms, they must arm themselves!  

Not only that, but having stared fascism straight in the face, in the form of Trump - the must admit that we are in eternal peril due to the genuine possibility of fascism. 

They must never vote for a person like Joe Biden who is assailing our collective ability to defend ourselves by way of the Second Amendment.

They should be gun owners of the highest order, with the latest weapons waiting in their closets for the time to come.  They should be **fierce** Second Amendment advocates.

I mean GOD DAMMIT, it’s LITERAL **MOTHERFUCKING FASCISM** - - isn’t it?  Isn’t it, though?  I mean that’s what they are saying.  They wouldn’t shit on the graves of all those actual victims of real fascism, would they?  No.  I don’t believe they would be that disgusting.

So it is resolved.  If they say it is “fascism” then I must believe they are telling it like they truly see it.  They wouldn’t be duplicitous mud slinging pieces of insincere SHIT, would they?  Pissing on the memories of the people who survived death camps?  Laughing at the ashes at the ones who didn’t survive?  Making mockery of the torture ... the rape ... the literal genocide?  No.  They can’t be that horrible.  They must be very, very **sincere!**

So let’s all put aside forever the idea that “it wouldn’t happen here”  - - It just “**happened** here,” and it can also happen **again** in the next election or the next one after that.

I expect my revolutionary brothers and sisters all to show us the modern arms they have purchased, and swear by the Second Amendment to their very deaths.

Otherwise, they are admitting that they are below filth, and that they will weaponize these mass murders, rapes, and tortures for trite political goals.

If Trump is re elected that is a validation to the populist wing of the GOP--who will continue to call the libertarian and moderate wings (Sasse, Romney, Kasich, Flake, etc and even some of the conservative wing like Rubio and somehow Cruz in 2016) RINOs for not kissing Trump's boot and eventually push some of us rank and file Republican voters out (just look at how traditionally Republican suburban counties moved in 2016 and 2018)

A defeat for Trump in November at least assures that the GOP moves to make serious efforts at courting minority voters and becoming the tolerant, big tent party that the Democrats fool people into believing they are and imagined by the autopsy with vibrant conservative, moderate and libertarian wings and if we must then a populist one as well--just no more Roy Moores, Steve Kings and Joe Arpaios.

The person who asked that is Tony Ashais sister. Tony Ashai who is rumored to have been supported to go to school by JKLF to spread their cause in western spheres. Kamala got trapped with the first question. Because she states a lot of things that are negative as fact so the responder has to come out and say it’s bad, but she took the political neutral way of saying we are watching. The second part Is the troubling portion because she stated that having an ambassador to Pakistan was a loss and they need to help in Kashmir. Pakistan themselves has admitted to participating in cross border terrorism, so this is actually a very dumb statement. 


With that said literally nothing will change in Kashmir. Geopolitically China is to America, as Pakistan is to India since Russia’s fall. Americans are trying their best to get India on their side to contain China. Kamala Harris, Joe Biden are all moderate Democrats which mean while they put out show for the emotional side of democrats that value theatrics, they are very strategic. They won’t risk alienating India. Modi and Obama are very close, they even wrote together for the Washington Post.  Modi did fuck up by endorsing Trump 2020, because the democrats won’t take too well to that ( but I would say it’s a snub he wanted to give due to the democrats signing anti India resolutions).

Frankly Indians also need to know if the entire world miraculously comes together with leftist government and says Kashmir is Pakistan, nothing would change either. India isn’t a small time country, it’s a nuclear power with a rather self efficient economy. It can literally tell the world to fuck off and everyone will listen.

Drugs or not, either way it’s extremely fucked up. Someone doing drugs doesn’t make them criminal and they shouldn’t be treated that way. They should be offered treatment and help to get out of the cycle, not demonized and murdered for it. As far as Biden goes, he literally wrote the crime bill that incarcerated millions of people for nonviolent drug crimes, and that group is overwhelmingly black men. He helped create the current prison industrial system that profits from locking people up over entirely victimless crimes. If you want to talk trump’s economy thought, black people were overwhelmingly left out of trump’s tax cuts and only received 5% of the total benefits compared to their 13% population. Trump has hampered police reform across the country, much of which was centered on actually building a good community presence with the police and their community. He’s advocated for increased police budged across the board since just about day 1. He cut support for prison halfway houses which would help people transition from prison life back into normal life. He’s encouraged federal prosecutors to increase punishment for drug related offenses, especially non-violent. This is all just to name a few.

Now they have one point of contact and all offices have to review the project in parallel and have a time limit of two years! This is called efficiency

2.	⁠Put tariffs and sanctions on China, Chinese companies (Huawei etc) and people (see HK and Xiang sanctions). (Joe Biden sold his influence and his son got billions out - do you really believe that’s the only money his son who has never worked in his life got from China?)

3.	⁠He changed the autonomous and drone laws (Via Elaine Chao the transport secretary) so we can test  drones and cars here! Because of Biden kitty hawk had to go to newzealand to test their autonomous aircraft!

4.	⁠Cut 8 regulations for one nee one - for example stupid epa regulations meant that if it rained hard on a farmers land and the run off was 12 inches in diameter  the run off became a national water body - wtf? That cost farmers tons of money and time to deal with and they could not work their land.

5.	⁠Opportunity zones - he gave tax incentives to companies that invest in poor communities - that has driven billions in investment in these communities providing jobs - do you think that the lowest jobless rates for minorities was just by chance? Biden presided as VP over the weakest growth they America has seen. They even said that the days of high growth for the US were over and jobs were never coming back!

6.	⁠Bringing in more money- by reducing the foreign profits/repatriated tax and adding a tax on all foreign profits even if they are not brought in he forced companies like google - Microsoft and Apple (all liberal bent companies that were storing profits offshore not to pay tax here) to pay a tax (billions on billions and bring money back.

7.	⁠He forced companies to bring manufacturing back! It was ok for us to buy japanese and german made products but not for us to make them here...think! It’s more expensive to make in Germany or Japan than the US! The argument for Biden’s BS that jobs are not coming back is just stupid.

8.	⁠By forcing China to buy more product he is diverting their spending in other countries to the US! We built chinas whole finance structure - our companies tutored then and give them a ton of money and they turn around and stab us! Think! Joe Biden took money from them openly - do you think he is good for our country?

9.	⁠He withdrew from TPP! Biden negotiates that dumb deal! Even Hillary admitted she would have withdrawn from that deal! Why do you want to hurt our country and people?

10.	⁠He brought energy prices down and security - why are we paying billions on billions to Saudi and other nations for energy? Oil and gas will go away on their own as a source of energy over time as solar and wind become cheaper - in the meantime don’t steal jobs away from people and don’t give money to foreign nations when the energy you have will slowly be less and less valuable. Focus on America!

11.	⁠When we have 20 percent unemployment does it make sense to bring in foreigners for jobs? It’s complete bullshit that there is no unemployment in the tech sector in Silicon Valley - that’s bs - temporary stop of H1b labor force is right for Americans! Employers in the valley have been keeping wages down - I live in California I see it all the time! Now with fewer jobs a lot of American tech folks got laid off - Biden does not support that - he (Biden) even called it xenophobic to put a travel ban on China (course he did he makes money off them!!)

12.	⁠Backing the police force and putting in place emergency laws and helping states that ask for security. Do you you believe that defunding the police is smart? The democrats refuse to speak about black on black crime, theft and drug use in black neighborhoods and murders in black neighborhoods because it’s in their agenda to create chaos!

13.	⁠Border - he stopped catch and release program where illegals were simply recorded and released into america. He reduced the illegal crossings.

14.	⁠He forced other countries to accept their illegal immigrants back - how? He threatened to stop issuing their elite visas to the US - they immediately started accepting their citizens back. What did Biden do? He wants to abolish ice and decriminalize crossing the border illegally! Listen to the Democratic debates they all want this!!!!

15.	⁠He got mexico to put 27 thousand troops to protect the US against illegal crossings

This is also the same Joe Biden that loyally served the first black president and would have made the first woman of African descent vice president should he win. Seems like they can recognize the difference between doing and saying something with malicious intent vs an inartfully crafted statement, a dumb joke, or something taken out of context. 

Meanwhile, in that same span of time, Trump was making numerous racist statements and committing numerous racist acts, including with the power of the presidency. Trump has single digit approval with black people in America. This is also the same Trump who's campaign seriously thought putting Kanye West on the ballot would split the black vote and diminish Biden.

So either, based on your ridiculous comment, you think millions of black people are hypocrites that know Biden is racist but don't care or ignore while attacking Trump for his racism or you think black people are somehow ignorant to Biden's racism and continue to support him because of said ignorance.

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/joe-biden-crime-bill-and-americans-short-memory/597547/

&gt;I guess that just doesn't fit your narrative, now does it?

I didn't say it didn't have broad support at the time. The implication is that he has bad judgement and a shit record - this doesn't change those facts. If the crime bill was the only thing in his record then sure I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. However Biden also supported the Iraq War, he partnered with Strom Thurmond to help increase civil asset forfeiture via the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act. He was a huge proponent of the war on drugs and STILL is against legalization of marijuana despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary of his publicly expressed beliefs about it.

Let's not forget that he voted for the patriot act, has recently advocated for increased law enforcement spending despite their already bloated budgets, and also proudly tried to cut social security multiple times.

His record is *terrible* and trying to paint him as a progressive is idiotic.

&gt;Biden has always been a convergence candidate. He stakes out a position as the middle of the wings of the party. That's one of the chief reasons Obama picked him. Did you forget that little fact, or did you simply not follow politics until the 2016 election cycle? 

Of course, Obama is a centrist. He pretended to be a progressive, then promptly turned into a centrist once in power. They've both always been centrists no matter how much they lie to you.

&gt;If you're actually a progressive who actually can vote, then you did a piss poor job of getting other progressives to the polls. Sorry, you're not the majority, and Bernie ran a shit campaign.

I can only do so much, but I can definitely say I both convinced people I know and also donated to his campaign. Between voter suppression and the DNC's super tuesday hail mary Bernie got trounced. I agree he ran a shit campaign - he was too naive and let the weasels around him convince him not to go on the offense. If he had, he might have won, even despite the DNC coalescing to prop up Joe's half-dead campaign at the time.

     “The totalitarian governments dug “giant holes in which to bury unwelcome facts and events, a gigantic enterprise which could be achieved only by killing millions of people who had been the actors or witnesses of the past.…” And for Miss Arendt, the most serious consequence for Americans of these “terrible disasters” in Europe was that “this form of criminality with its bloodbaths has remained the conscious or unconscious standard by which we measure what is permitted or prohibited in politics.” Public opinion, that is, has been dangerously inclined to accept anything short of murder as “just politics.””

Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have been instrumental in upholding institutions of oppression (private prisons, police unions) throughout their entire political careers. This VP nomination comes at a time when the relationship between law enforcement and the general public is the lowest it’s been in recent memory. You may consider yourself a savvy politics understand but you’re a halfwit if you think these things are pedantic.

It won’t be damage reduction when Biden loses because his platform is dogshit and inspires hope in NOBODY. Politics isn’t about choosing the right side, it’s about improving material conditions.

8/13/2020,I was born and raised in Washington state and in US culture it can be very complicated about YES and NO. Some Americans will respect that you think it’s boring here and will try to show you the fun but other hard patriots will get pissed at you. In the US we are raised to thing America is number 1 and better than everyone else. I’ve been talking about immigrating to Russia and some Americans have been like “oh yeah I’m done with it here” while other would be like “you’re a fucking traitor to the US you fucking Ivan” and go on an hour long rant about how America is great and other countries suck. So realistically to avoid trouble I’d just say that the culture here is very interesting. Not saying you like it but not saying you hate it. Saying anything bad about the US can lead you to some unwanted trouble with the locals here. Put it simply Americans are very defensive over the US and will be quick to tell you that you’re wrong and the US is the best thing ever. So try to avoid saying anything negative about the US to Americans and avoid politics at all costs. Many people are gonna ask if you’re voting for joe Biden or Donald trump and picking one could lead you to trouble if the other person disagrees with you. I’ve seen full on fist fights over politics before usually a leftist and rightist. Just say that you’re a tourist and the culture is interesting.,-0.0569

That's not a problem, that's a feature. The fact that through their tremendous ineptitude and unintelligence they'll be capitalising on less checks and making even more mistakes, the common man will be put under even more pressure to rise up. You know, so long as that inept leader isn't genocidal in their intentions. And that they believe climate change is a threat.

&gt; What's to stop warlords from constantly fighting eachother in a power vacuum that ultimately impacts the lives of innocents the most?

That's what we already do currently, no? Leaders of different countries bombing each other over scarce resources as the globe is being microwaved. The innocents who get their homes bombed and their families broken pick up the pieces.
The important distinction here is that the purpose of creating this power vacuum is that it would be easier to make an equal society in a period in which capitalism has failed us than one where it's only just being discovered to be evil. We'd only be speeding things along.

&gt;What makes it likely that global worker power will occur (American going down the shitter doesn't suddenly mean every other country in the world does too) before the rampant effects of runaway climate change really start to kick in later this century? We're likely already past the point of no return, so mitigation and damage control is all we can do in relation to climate change. It's fucking idiotic to want to speed its effects up before some sort of organizational developments have been worked out.

...What the fuck are you smoking? Who said anything about wanting to specifically speed up climate change? There's no usable pressure to rise up when you're dying in constant floods. No need to pull bad faith arguments out of your ass. Do you really think everyone is just going to wait till everything turns into an uninhabitable desert, or do you think it would be more realistic to suggest that capitalists doubling down on what they already do (placing workers in unsafe environments, lowering pay etc) is going to pressure people to find a solution? Climate change is already slowly being solved by the people in power around the globe currently, so to suggest that the only way a collapse could occur is through climate change taking its course is [utter nonsense](https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideclimatenews.org/news/24062019/joe-biden-climate-change-global-warming-election-2020-candidate-profile%3famp) on your end.",-0.0553

**Article**:

&gt; The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted Thursday to keep Kanye West off the state’s ballot for November&amp;apos;s presidential election.

&gt; The commission found that West and his running mate Michelle Tidball missed the Aug. 5  deadline required for a candidate to submit at least 2,000 signatures in order to get on the ballot.

&gt; West, who is running as an Independent on a presidential ticket he has deemed the “Birthday Party,” was reportedly minutes late in submitting his 2,422 signatures.

&gt; Michael Curran, West’s campaign attorney, argued that the staffer delivered the signatures in the building 14 seconds past 5 p.m., but the commission staff still accepted the signatures.

&gt; Commission staffer Cody Davies explained to the commission panel that he received a call from a West staffer at 4:57 p.m. to say they were three minutes away.

&gt; Davies had to let them in as the doors were locked due to coronavirus regulations, but said he waited in the lobby for the staffer to arrive.

&gt; At 14 seconds after 5 p.m. the staffer entered the building and they rode the elevator up together at 50 seconds past 5 p.m.

&gt; Riley Willman, another commission staff member, told the panel that he received the signatures at 5:01 p.m., but they were not organized so he had to wait several minutes until he took possession of the signatures.

&gt; Wisconsin’s Election Commission is split three to three, Democrat and Republican, but in a 5-1 vote, they found that West was not eligible to join the state’s ballot Thursday.

&gt; Commissioner Robert Spindell, a Republican, was the only one to vote in favor of putting West on the ballot.

&gt; Spindell argued that the pandemic has made life more difficult and if the doors had been unlocked this could have played a role in submitting the papers on time – despite the testimony that the commission staff member was waiting in the lobby for West’s signatures to arrive.

&gt; Spindell also reportedly said that Democrats were just trying to make it harder for a Black presidential candidate to join the ticket, and that Black voters should have a choice.

&gt; Democrats likewise have argued that Republicans have been pushing support for West in order to syphon votes away from the Biden-Harris ticket.

&gt; “We are talking a matter of seconds here,” Spindell said.

&gt; But the other five commissioners said that the deadline of 5 p.m. needed to be followed, not 5:00:14.

&gt; “This is one of the closest call cases I’ve seen but consistency requires me to treat all candidates the same, regardless of their party or their color or any other characteristics,” Republican Commissioner Dean Knduson reportedly said. “I think the complainants have evidence that he was late.”

&gt; West could challenge the decision in court, if he chooses to.

&gt; Wisconsin is a swing state and proving to be a contentious battleground between the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates.

&gt; The Trump administration visited the state three times this week alone, as the Democratic National Convention (DNC) was set in the capital of Milwaukee. Former Vice President Joe Biden will not give his DNC acceptance speech from Wisconsin, instead giving it live from his home state of Delaware because of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; The Biden campaign also chose to have the convention held by way of virtual events and speeches in light of the pandemic.

&gt; Trump narrowly won Wisconsin during the 2016 presidential race with 47.9 percent of the vote, whereas Clinton received 46.9 percent of the votes – meaning the Trump campaign won by just over 27,000 votes.

&gt; But Wisconsin voted blue in the 2012 and 2008 elections.

&gt; Barack Obama won 52.8 percent of votes as opposed to Mitt Romney’s 46.1 percent in 2012, and 56.3 percent in 2008 compared to John McCain’s 42.4 percent of votes.

You are by far the most ignorant person I have encountered that is acting like they know what they are talking about.

You have shown that not only have you never taken a class on politics but even the lowest campaign volunteer that works on canvassing or phone banking for 1 month knows not only what a platform actually is, but what the details of the candidate's, they are working for, platform is. 

You are a backseat driver that only bitches and does nothing to change the system. If you can't be fucking bothered to read AOC's actual views on the Biden platform, **WHICH SHE WORKED ON**, then I am not going to hold your hand through basic 101 education. She literally got 2 trillion dollars proposal in the Biden/DNC platform that will create Green Energy infrastructure for a 100% green energy US by 2035 and you are sitting here bitching about a few minutes of speech time. That is only 5 years off the Green New Deal's goal. The vice president is a co sponsor of multiple progressive policy goals including the above.

I really like this piece by Jason Hickel. 

FWIW, I think a big reason so many people believe in stuff like Q is that they were raised to view capitalism almost in religious terms. They’ve never thought to question it. I’m not saying everyone HAS to become a socialist/communist/anarchist but if you can see that we have problems caused by capitalism which is a system created by humans not some innate structure ordained by G_d or whatnot, you’d be less prone to such conspiratorial thinking?

&gt;* If Senate business ran late - Senate late - and Biden missed the 10 pm train, he didn’t just grab a hotel room. His DC driver drove him up the GW Parkway to Maryland House, where the Delaware driver met us and took him home.

&gt;* Thing is it wasn’t always clear he’d not make the 10 pm train. One night we made a mad dash. I thought we made it. But, PER PROTOCOL of being 23 and terrified of leaving Joe Biden at Union Station, I hung around. He called a couple minutes later and asked where I was.

&gt;* When he emerged from Union Station, he was with another gentleman. They were laughing. I figured he’d spotted and old friend. Then they both got in my Jetta. “This is John,” Biden said. “He’s grabbing a ride back to Delaware with us. We both missed the train.”

&gt;* What became clear over the next five minutes as Joe Biden asked the man about his life was that they were total strangers and that the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee just invited a random person to ride with us for 90 minutes in the dead of night.

&gt;* A total stranger. Not because he knew him or thought him important. But just because he was a person in need - a person who missed the last train and needed a ride home. Question that judgment, SURE, but don’t question the sincerity or desire to help people.",-0.0526

They violently oppose anyone with whom they disagree – often times to the point of deadly physical violence and death itself. They are responsible for the brutal killing and destruction of countless American lives – and in this particular case the majority of the lives and livelihoods they are destroying are those of Black Americans. Yet this is who the dems support – Joe Biden has donated money to bail them out of jail. Keith Ellison (the former Chairman of the DNC) has openly declared his support of Antifa, and his son just did so this past week. The mayor of Berkeley has proudly boasted about him being a card-carrying member of Antifa. Countless other dems, including each of the members of the “Squad” and even those who are less “extreme” also support and defend them. Not to mention the massive outpouring of liberals/regressives who have tweeted their support for Antifa since President Trump rightfully announced its designation as a terrorist regime. The dems literally support terrorists now. Remember this in November – ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.  #Neveragain",-0.0525

The group, Minnesota Freedom Fund, bailed out multiple criminals, including Darnika Floyd, who allegedly stabbed a friend to death; and Christopher Boswell, who is facing charges for sexual assault and kidnapping, [according to Fox 9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-nonprofit-with-35m-bails-out-those-accused-of-violent-crimes).

Both criminals received hundreds of thousands of dollars in bail money from MFF. The group put up $100,000 on Floyd’s behalf, and $350,000 on Boswell’s behalf.

MFF also bailed out Jaleel Stallings, who allegedly shot at police during the May riots, and Donovan Boone, who was charged with invading the home of his ex-girlfriend and choking her. Stallings was bailed out for $75,000 and Boone was bailed out for $3,000.

Tired of feeling crazy for wanting better for our country and being gaslighted in to believing I'm being unreasonable. Biden and his policies are on the right track, but they do nothing to delay the inevitable fall of the American empire and our descent in to fascism. Climate change is coming for our ass, Medicare for All should be PRIORITY NUMBER ONE. Biden is not strong enough on those two pivotal issues for me. Citizens United will stay, foreign interventionist policies will still kill brown people the world over, black people will get locked up for non-violent offenses, education will not be free for all. Military spending will not be cut. We are fucked. Most other developed countries have these things. Our system is in absolute decline fall of Rome style we need serious overhaul now.

All you centrist fucks don't deserve Bernie after the way dems and media treated him. Hit pieces from WAPO and NY TIMES, CNN and MSNBC running little to no coverage of his campaign. The party coalescing against him after he gained momentum in the early campaign. And yet time and again he does the right thing and tries to right the ship steering policy for this shitty ass party and delivering bomb speeches for candidates whose careers are built on lies and corporate money.

8/13/2020,"&gt;The fact that Senator Kamala Harris has just been named the vice presidential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has some questioning her eligibility for the position. The 12th Amendment provides that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” And Article II of the Constitution specifies that “[n]o person except a natural born citizen…shall be eligible to the office of President.” Her father was (and is) a Jamaican national, her mother was from India, and neither was a naturalized U.S. citizen at the time of Harris’ birth in 1964. That, according to these commentators, makes her not a “natural born citizen”—and therefore ineligible for the office of the president and, hence, ineligible for the office of the vice president.  
  
&gt;“So before we so cavalierly accept Senator Harris’ eligibility for the office of vice president, we should ask her a few questions about the status of her parents at the time of her birth,” Eastman insists.

To me it feels as if there has been a change in the public opinion recently.

When the BLM Protests started there was the narrative that the BLM Protests are the fight for Human Rights against an inhuman system. And it appeared as if it was Human Rights against Trump. Somehow the Democrats managed to be on the Team which is fighting against an inhuman system and everybody seemed oblivious to the fact that the Democrats are a vital part of that system and that this system is and has been run by them too. But the moral was on their side and police attacking peaceful protestors was Trumps failure.

But as time went by we saw the ugly things and the stupid ideas of the Protests and a pretty bad decision making by democratic politicians. Crime rates went abnormal high in your democrat led major cities, fueled by the idea that there is no need for law enforcement engagement. The Riots in Portland and Chaz in Seattle and it somehow seemed that democratic politicians didnt want to stop that, because this was their voters on the street and they didnt want to send a strong police force to stop the riots. In that case they would be blamed for police brutality and lose the momentum of being the good guy.

That was the ammunition for the Republicans. Crime Rates spiked, defund/abolish the police, open the borders, kneel at the national anthem, bringing statues down, Joe Biden really not looking in best shape, kampala harris as VP pick who accused Biden of racism...

All this led to the narrative that the Republicans now stand for law and order, american values and that the democrats stand for chaos and socialism.

The moral went to the Republicans recently. Am i totally wrong?",-0.0497

Things suck for you so instead of putting some effort forth you want to make them suck for anyone else. Either that or you have some fantasies about shooting people but the reality is all the folks you want to shoot are better at this kind of thing than you are. You wouldn't take any of them with you, either.


&gt;It's not about having given up. It's about what is possible and not possible. 

Yeah, the fact that you think it's better for millions of people to die in a violent revolution means you've given up. You've quit. You don't have the will to actually do anything. You won't even bother putting in any effort, just default to a fight that you won't have the balls to fight.

&gt;The Democratic National Committee this week quietly dropped language calling for an end to fossil fuel subsidies and tax breaks from its party platform, HuffPost has learned. 

&gt;On July 27, officials added an amendment to the Manager’s Mark, a ledger of party demands voted on as one omnibus package, stating: “Democrats support eliminating tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuels, and will fight to defend and extend tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy.”

&gt;**The amendment was approved. But the statement ― which reflects pledges presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, each made on the campaign trail ― disappeared from the final draft of the party platform circulated Monday.**

&gt;**In an emailed statement, a DNC spokesperson said the amendment was “incorrectly included in the Manager’s Mark” and taken out “after the error was discovered.”** 

&gt;Activists accused the DNC of retroactively removing the amendment from the final draft of the platform. 

&gt;“This is ridiculous,” Collin Rees, a campaigner with the nonprofit Oil Change U.S., said by phone. “This is a commonsense position held by both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. … The DNC should immediately include it in the platform.” 

&gt;**Greenpeace ranked the DNC platform a C-plus in a new grade set to be released Wednesday, giving the official party manifesto a lower rating than the B-plus proposals Biden and Harris each ran on in the presidential primary.** 

&gt;**“This platform is a step backwards, and we deserve better,” Charlie Jiang, a campaigner at Greenpeace, said in a statement sent with the nonprofit’s new ranking. **

8/18/2020,"Em junho, o site de verificação de fatos Factcheck.org criticou [Joe Biden](https://asos-em-estados-republicanos-expoe-trump-e-pode-selar-vitoria-de-biden.shtml), em um “post” intitulado “Biden alardeia teoria de conspiração eleitoral sem base sólida”. A questão é que Biden havia dado a entender que [Donald Trump ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/trump-diz-que-voto-universal-por-correio-sera-catastrofico.shtml)desejava “cortar o dinheiro do correio para que este não possa entregar votos realizados por via postal”. Segundo o site, não havia provas de que “a posição de Trump com relação ao sistema postal dos Estados Unidos se relacione com a eleição presidencial”.

 Poucos dias atrás, o Factcheck.org reconheceu que Biden estava certo, na verdade. A confirmação? Declarações do próprio Trump.

 Nancy Pelosi está convocando os deputados da Câmara Federal, que está em recesso de verão, para debater um projeto de lei sobre o assunto, e com bom motivo. Temos não só uma mas duas crises constitucionais a caminho. A primeira é que milhões de votos podem não ser contados. A segunda é que atrasos na contagem de votos encaminhados por via postal podem [permitir que Trump ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/discurso-contra-voto-por-correio-pode-prejudicar-trump-em-estados-chave.shtml)afirme vitória em uma eleição que ele na verdade perdeu.

 Esses pesadelos quanto a novembro são o motivo para que precisemos agir urgentemente para garantir a integridade [do serviço postal dos Estados Unidos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/trump-diz-que-voto-universal-por-correio-sera-catastrofico.shtml). Mas também existe um aspecto maior, no ataque ao correio. Ele é parte de uma ofensiva mais ampla contra as instituições que mantêm nossa unidade nacional.

 Afinal de contas, havia um motivo para que a constituição conferisse especificamente ao Congresso a capacidade de “estabelecer correios e estradas postais”. Os fundadores claramente entendiam algum sistema postal nacional como uma maneira de transformar em realidade a ideia, ainda hesitante, de fazer dos Estados Unidos uma nação. Na verdade, em seus primeiros anos, um dos papéis essenciais do correio era a entrega de jornais, como forma de manter os americanos informados e conectados.

  O serviço postal na forma que conhecemos não emergiu de uma vez. Em lugar disso, evoluiu gradualmente, por meio de um acúmulo tanto de legislação formal quanto de precedentes.

 A entrega direta de correspondência a domicílios urbanos só veio a começar em 1863, e a entrega rural gratuita só surgiu definitivamente em 1902. O serviço de entregas de pacotes não surgiu antes de 1913; antes, os usuários rurais tinham de confiar em um cartel de empresas privadas que conspiravam para manter elevadas as tarifas de envio.

 Todas essas mudanças, no entanto, tinham um tema comum: colocar os americanos em contato uns com os outros, e com o mundo em geral, com mais facilidade. Parte chave da missão do correio é que este tem uma “obrigação de serviço universal”, a de “unir a nação” e “facilitar a inclusão dos cidadãos”.

 Por boa parte da história dos Estados Unidos, isso envolvia principalmente oferecer a áreas remotas o acesso aos frutos do progresso econômico urbano. É difícil superestimar a diferença que o serviço de mala direta, tornado possível pela expansão do sistema postal, fez para a qualidade da vida rural. E a entrega de correspondência continua vital em áreas rurais, que são mal servidas (e a custo muito alto) pelas empresas privadas de entregas.

 Mas não devemos falar apenas das populações rurais. O correio continua a ser vital, em muitos casos literalmente, para os muitos americanos que, por qualquer que seja o motivo, têm capacidade limitada de, por exemplo, visitar uma farmácia para apanhar os remédios que lhes são receitados. O Departamento de Serviços a Veteranos entrega pelo correio cerca de 80% dos medicamentos distribuídos sob receita aos pacientes que atende.

 Quando irrompeu [a crise quanto ao voto pelo correio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/democratas-pedem-ao-fbi-abertura-de-investigacao-sobre-obstrucao-de-voto-por-correio.shtml), alguns dos suspeitos habituais, na ala direita, começaram a denunciar o correio como um mau negócio, deficitário. Mas os fundadores não incluíram a cláusula postal na constituição porque vissem o serviço postal como oportunidade de negócios; o correio tinha por objetivo servir a objetivos nacionais mais amplos –e ainda o faz.

 Mas, talvez você pergunte, por que essa lógica deveria ser aplicar apenas ao correio? Não deveríamos, então, apoiar outras instituições que mantêm a união nacional? Sim, e o fazemos.

 A Administração da Eletrificação Rural, criada na década de 1930 para levar a eletricidade a áreas rurais, tinha por objetivo a unificação nacional, além do desenvolvimento econômico –e, começando em 1949, subsidiou também a expansão das redes de telefonia rural. O Sistema Rodoviário Interestadual foi justificado em parte por afirmações dúbias quanto à segurança nacional, mas teve o efeito de reforçar a união do país.

 E a internet? Deveríamos ter uma política para garantir que os americanos tenham acesso também à telecomunicação moderna? Na verdade, sim. ​

 O acesso à internet nos Estados Unidos é muito mais caro do que em outros países avançados porque operadores privados que funcionam quase sem regulamentação abusam de seu poder de mercado, assim como as empresas privadas de entregas exploravam os agricultores antes da criação do serviço de entrega de pacotes pelo correio.

 É claro que não devemos esperar que cada serviço da economia moderna seja sujeitado à obrigação de serviço universal. Nem todos precisamos de acesso a clubes de golfe ou a barcos particulares, para participar plenamente da vida nacional.

 Mas a maioria dos americanos –o que provavelmente inclui a maioria dos 91% do público cuja opinião sobre o correio é positiva– acredita que algumas coisas deveriam estar disponíveis universalmente, mesmo que fornecê-las não seja lucrativo, porque elas são componentes importantes da cidadania plena.

 Infelizmente, Trump e aqueles que o cercam não compartilham dessa crença, talvez por não aceitarem a ideia de “cidadania plena”, para começar. E esse é um dos motivos para que venham tentando paralisar o correio, além do fato de que isso representa sua melhor chance de roubar a eleição.

8/19/2020,"I don’t think it is so clear-cut. If the choice was between Donald Trump and a moderate social democrat like Bernie Sanders, I think there would be good arguments in favor of voting for Sanders as the lesser evil (even though he is not a socialist and did not oppose all illegal wars of aggressions of the US).

But Joe Biden? An extremist neoliberal warmonger - it is obvious that there would be a lot of harm with Joe Biden, as with Donald Trump, I am not so sure about the reduction.

Different people may have different limits. For some, unlike for me, even voting for Bernie Sanders as a means for harm reduction might go too far. For some, even small differences between two far-right imperialists like Biden and Trump may be enough for voting for the one considered slightly less terrible (which would go too far for me).

I would not be certain which of Trump and Biden is the greater and which is the lesser evil. Many neocons seem to prefer Biden, and one of the main criticism of Trump by many establishment Democrats seems to be is that Trump is not hawkish enough and „talks with authoritarian governments“. This may be a sign that Biden would actually be the greater evil. On the other hand, of course, Trump has also appointed neocons to many important positions. So, I think the main point should not be discussing which one might be slightly less evil, but stating and convincing people that they are both very dangerous, and whichever will be elected must be resisted with all force.",-0.0459

There, we learned about what the delegate process entailed and connected with a campaign of our choice. Then, all potential delegates filled out an application, and got slated from the campaign with 3-5 other delegates depending on the size of the Congressional district. Once that happened, delegates would begin collecting over 200 petition signatures (during the brutal winter too -- yikes!). After that, the IL State Board of Elections approves the signatures and campaigning begins and lasts until March. Delegates aren’t officially bound to the majority votes of their states -- I, as a Biden delegate, could have voted for Bernie if I wanted to during the voting process. In terms of what is involved as a delegate -- you are elected by your Congressional district and it is considered a public office. Once you’re elected, you join thousands of other delegates during the DNC Convention to vote for the presumptive Democratic Party nominee during those famous roll calls. We also typically attend caucus meetings in which we can have influence over the Democratic Party's platform. But all of this was obviously virtual this time around.

8/21/2020,"It had been three days and Trump and Biden were still sexting on Snapchat.

It felt so wrong... but also so right.

It was so all consuming that Trump had put Putin out of his mind completely.

The Russian’s snaps had been left on read and Trump hardly noticed the bold text or smirking emoji next to it.

He had a new play toy now.

The American people were starting to wonder if the president was okay.

He had been completely absent from press conferences and his usual routine Tweets were barren.

His advisors insisted that he needed to make a move or people would begin to speculate that he too was sick with Covid-19 -- but Trump just ignored them.

“If you talk to me again, I will fire you like the rest of them,” He said in one final, angry text.

Instead of dealing with politics, Trump was busy dealing with Biden’s body.

He had found in these past few days that this secret affair was just what he needed to get through these long, laborious days.

He met Joe on Zoom dates, FaceTime and Snapchat.

But Trump wanted more.

One evening, as he sat in his bedroom on a plush tempurpedic mattress that had cost $10,000 dollars, he texted Biden those two glorious words.

“cum over,” Trump implored.

He knew it wasn’t allowed due to the pandemic - that it was going against the warnings of every medical advisor and most of his cabinet. 

But he just couldn’t wait.

He needed Biden now.

Plus, science and medicine had never stopped him before so how could it stop him now -- now that he needed Biden’s body more than ever.

“i can’t,” Biden shot back within minutes, accompanied by a sensual pic of his aging groin, “coronavirus :(“

“ur going to let that stop u???” Trump demanded, “when u could have this?”

His rotund orange tummy protruded across his phone camera like a ripe tangerine.

“give it to me, daddy,” He added for effect - Biden wouldn’t be able to deny him.

Not now, and not ever.

“fine,” Biden said, “u come here. 2 person meeting only.”

But that wasn’t enough for Trump, who had an endless supply of young working man’s blood to sustain himself if he ever got sick.

He would share with Biden... in exchange for sex.

He was about to argue as much, when his phone dinged a long sensual ding again.

“jk….” Biden wrote, “i’m cumming 2 u”

- - -

Trump was sprawled out across his expensive bed when Biden climbed his rackety old bones up the tree to get to his window.

In an unprecedented move of generosity, Trump had allowed Demetri, his head of staff, to order the rest of the White House staff to shelter in place in order for Biden to access him without dealing with security.

He could hear the arthritic crack of Biden’s joints as he shimmied up the tree, clawing towards the window sill. 

Trump lazily gazed at him, struggling.

“Work for me, you lazy democrat,” Trump muttered sensually.

Biden chuckled. “I am an establishment dem,” he purred, “and therefore, we are more politically similar than you could ever imagine.”

“I know that,” Trump rolled his eyes, “I just wanted to do a roleplay where you actually give a shit about the working class and I can oppress you with my giant MAGA cock.”

“I’ve seen your cock,” Biden said, finally letting himself in. He crawled across Trump’s bed like a spider, “and it is not great by any measure.”

Trump shivered. “But you can’t get enough of it.”

They locked eyes.

Both politicians knew the appeal of the affair came from the secrecy and not from any attraction to one another.

If they were actually queer and gave a shit about gay rights, they might be slightly cooler, but instead they were just getting off on being rich establishment GodLord politicians and had a long voting history of homophobia and racism to boot. 

“Pretend you give a shit about the American people,” Trump cooed, “For me, Joe.”

Biden shook his head. “I can’t do that. I already do that on the campaign trail all the time and it’s hard, Don. Let me just be an evil megalomaniac like you. It works better for me on account of my dementia...”

That didn’t really compute to Trump.

Sex to him had always been about asserting his power and wealth over the other person and if they were equally power-hungry and rich, what was the point?

Still, Biden was here and he was horny.

Trump was in no place to argue with his demands.

“Fuck me, daddy,” said Biden in a truly disgusting way. “I want to feel your stimulus package deep inside of me.”

They hopped on top of eachother and had sex in a truly unremarkable and unsatisfying way.

In that moment, they understood the pain the author was in when he wrote this, because neither of them prepped or used lube.

It was terrible just like this story.

8/22/2020,"Public option is not single payer. By definition, since it is only an option, it is not the only payer of health care costs, which means it doesn't have the diverse risk pool or leverage when negotiating drug costs.

A public option (where you can choose to buy public insurance) might be even worse than sticking with the ACA until we can pass single payer because a public option is unsustainable and guaranteed to go bankrupt due to the fact that the private option will find various ways to offload the sickest and poorest customers onto the public option while keeping the healthiest and wealthiest customers for them to profit off of, thus leaving the public option with all of the risk from sick people but none of the funding from (for now) healthy people.

Setting up a public health insurance system that's destined to fail like this is meant to discredit the whole notion of public health insurance in the same way that politicians who have slashed budgets and sabotaged parts of Medicare, Medicaid, VA and now the USPS, and then point to those public programs' flaws as evidence that they need to be privatized.

I don't agree with Joe Biden much on policy. But I think he fundamentally understands the basic notion of rule of law, limits on executive power and checks and balances, and will govern with stability, will listen to experts and will restore America's dignity and relationships with our allies. He won't tweet Mussolini quotes or call his political opponents names like a 5-year old. He knows presidents are supposed to be calming and reassuring and show leadership in times of crisis, not escalate the problem and use it as a political power grab to flex your muscles.

&gt;No, third parties can't win, not in this system.

Actual change can't happen through the democrats. Not in this system. Again, even a bad strategy is better than one that's proven to fail. 

The argument for third parties is the hope that they can get to 5%, then 7%, then 10% over several years and eventually control a big enough minority that the democrats are *forced* to make concessions to the left. I don't actually think that's likely to happen lol, but as idiotic and idealistic as it is to believe that, it's *infinitely* more pragmatic and realistic than doing the same thing for 50+ years and expecting a different result.

Realistically I think protesting, organizing and striking are way more likely to actually accomplish something. Or local elections. But I'm not voting for Biden regardless so it's third party or not voting. Even if I believed in lesser evilism, I live in a safe blue state, my vote is barely more than a symbolic gesture. I'm not gonna waste it on Joe fucking Biden. And if that bothers you, you can eat my fucking asshole.

Newsflash, 8 years of Obama are what led to Trump. We've been hurtling toward the brink for a long time, it's voting for the lesser evil that fucking led us here. Every time you choose the lesser evil over the greater, they *both get worse.* You're not even reducing harm, you're just deferring it.

&gt;Do you really think we'd be here if the succession of presidents since Clinton read Gore, Obama, Clinton?

If if if. Lmao your ifs are fucking worthless because **that would never fucking happen.** Do you think it's just a random coincidence that these two parties have been trading power back and forth for the better part of a century? 

If the lesser evil wins this time then the greater evil will win next time. Both parties are completely corrupt and incapable of actually addressing the material causes of our problems so people will always get dissatisfied with the party in power eventually.

8/19/2020,"&gt; Polls show Trump trailing badly against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Trump, who fancies himself a marketing genius, has so damaged the Republican brand that the party is in danger of losing Senate seats in Montana, Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina and Maine — for starters. Even in South Carolina, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham is having to look over his shoulder at Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison, who outraised him last quarter. The GOP’s 53-to-47 majority is in real peril of being erased.

&gt; Republicans could have decided to cut Trump loose and try to save themselves — and, in the end, perhaps some will take that route. But Trump has so remade the Republican base in his own image, including by providing encouragement to a near-cult, that, as Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the party whip, told Politico: “I just think that everybody realizes that our fortunes sort of rise or fall together.”

In 2008 Obama was all for limiting ilegal immigration when his oponent was from a border state

Democrats literally win midterm elections like 2018 and take over the process of writing budgets and then make every little thing that happens into a mass panic so they can increase government spending and blame the subsequent rise in the deficit on republicans to win the next election.

The Obama administration also tried to undermine president Trumps election even before the results were in.

3) Donald Trump *WILL NOT* accept the results of the election if he loses. We will not know who the president is for a few days (worst case scenario: a few weeks). Trump will use this time of uncertainty to create absolute chaos. He knows the more doubt he creates the higher the chance of the SCOTUS stepping in like they did in 2000. He currently has a majority in the court and it is very likely they would vote in his favor.

The ONLY way to prevent this is to have a massive, record breaking turn out. Joe Biden needs to have a landline victory — anything less and Donald Trump will use that to question his legitimacy.

I both believe that Biden has often put his hands on people’s shoulders in ways that made them uncomfortable (I’ve seen videos confirming this), yet still believe this does not disqualify him from holding elected office. Apparently I’m on the same page as Kamala Harris here.

Biden himself apparently believes he’s made people uncomfortable. On [the same day](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2019/4/3/18294162/joe-biden-touching-allegations-response) as Harris’s statement, Biden said:

However, as Tara Reade’s accusations started to shift and go through various permutations, Kamala Harris, like much of the public, took a step back and waited to see where the story was going — apparently nowhere, given that even the Trump campaign hasn’t found Tara Reade credible enough to use against Biden.

8/14/2020,"unlike america, their healthcare industries haven’t had decades of lobbying as sole providers of healthcare that allowed them to become huge influences in govt. 

“hey, fuck you, people who make profit off of healthcare and payroll a large amount of congress aren’t going to be a part of public non-profit healthcare negotiations, because *they won’t exist*” is a great starting point if you want to avoid corruption of the bill. 

the worst thing that could happen to the healthcare fight in america is if insurance companies band together to influence the public option into a dumping ground for their expensive low income and sick patients while gutting its actual efficiency so healthy and rich people will gravitate towards a private plan that actually is funded. because if that happens and an underfunded public option is passed, republicans and moderate democrats will point to its passing for decades to show that the public option simply won’t work in america, basically ending the fight for a humane system.

What I want is to be treated the same as anyone else in my situation and to the left alone to live my life. That’s it. Donald Trump furthers that purpose merely by existing and preventing the left from taking power.

Private Insurance companies donate heavily to the Democratic Party and they are obviously against any policy that would get rid of their entire profit mechanism.

Democrats wouldn't even take it up to vote on, let alone it getting rejected despite having a majority. It's sad that an issue so popular with Democrats is shunned by the establishment. It's things like this that make the younger generation, typically Bernie voters so mad that they threaten to not show up.

There is the case to be made that if Democrats do win, it would mean they move to the left, but that wasn't the case with Obama and I doubt it'd be the case with Biden.

He won the 2016 election by using this strategy of branding his opponents, so if it works, it works. I also think that he has a much better sense of humor than Obama.

It is hard to pin down and his energy can be higher or lower at times, but he is in his 70s now and I think it shows.

I say this because my worst fears of his mental condition by the time he leaves office, at the age of 81, are that he'd be on par with where Trump is currently, but even that I really doubt. Not everything Biden says is a winner, but I can barely listen to Trump without thinking about how he sounds like my brain-damaged mother does when talking, or how much of a mess his speaking is and how easily he looses his train of thought.

You are not pro looting, but you want the issue to be addressed and taken seriously by politicians.
Democrats go to you and the lefties say 'defund the police' while the moderates say 'reform the police' but they both want to address the issue and give you a 'i hear you', at least that.

What do the republicans do? Their media demonize BLM as well as they can and do not really address their demands (except when some local BLM leader says s th stupid). Trump doesnt go out there and say 'I heat you, I will deal with this problem and there will be a police reform'.
Trump reacts by saying that he will quench the riots (which includes the actual protests) and does so by a very tonedeaf measure, sending troops.

Biden is not a leftie. Vice versa, Biden wants to increase police budget to reform them. https://www.google.com/search?q=biden+police+violence&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8
I am a full on defund the police leftie, i think Biden's plan is not good and I think his record on police is quite bad.
BUT: Biden has SOMETHING. Even if his plan is hardly what BLM demands, he throws them some scraps and at least admits that there is in fact a problem.

Trump has done nothing to stop us bombing the middle east, and he has done nothing  to keep us out of wars that we have no business in. He's put us on the brink of war with Syria earlier this year, which would've meant a war with Russia too. That being said, Biden would've done similar stuff,

Trump also screwed over the country to benefit his wallet. He and his cabinet knew how bad COVID-19 could be, yet did nothing to close the borders and mandate quarantine until well after it hit the US badly. Not to mention he spent most of quarantine saying it was a hoax, while everyone around him was getting it. He didn't even try to stop it until it was costing him his chance at reelection.

He handled BLM in a horrible way too. He called the national guard to peaceful protests about police brutality, and said that George Floyd was looking down at the US and was happy because of the state of the economy. Not to mention that he kicked protestors out of an area just so he could hold a bible upside down for a photo op.

Finally, he has no successful leadership skills. He's gone bankrupt 3 times, and divorced twice, not to mention he had neither former military nor government experience.

8/21/2020,"Rap artist, entrepreneur and aspiring presidential candidate Kanye West, a Chicago native, did not qualify to appear on Illinois’ Nov. 3 ballot, the Illinois State Board of Elections decided Friday.

Board members, acting to finalize the fall ballot, voted 8-0 that West, whose independent campaign has been associated with a number of Republican operatives in other states, fell short of filing the required number of signatures needed to appear on the ballot.

The move by the board, made up equally of Republicans and Democrats, was not surprising after two separate binder checks reviewing the authenticity of West’s candidacy petitions found they fell far below the minimum needed.

Of the 3,128 signatures West filed with the elections board on July 20, one review found 1,928 of them were invalid, leaving him 1,300 signatures short of the 2,500 needed to become an independent candidate on the Illinois ballot.
The 2,500 signature standard is actually 10 times lower than usually required under a federal court order prompted by challenges to state law by third-party and independent candidates who cited personal restrictions due to the pandemic hindered their efforts to circulate petitions. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the modified filing rules Thursday.

Good lord all your points are such tired bullshit. The fact that I complain about neolibs doesn't mean I'm ignoring fascists. Literally everyone in the uj thread agrees trump is fucking awful. There's no disagreement about it. There *absolutely is* disagreement about people like Biden or Harris, and while the primary was going on, there was a whole lot of arguing about how terrible people like Buttigieg or Yang were. When everyone knows trump is a fascist piece of shit, I don't feel the need to make an alt account just to repeatedly say it.

I don't know what your reasoning is for saying nobody has ever disagreed with my criticisms of various neoliberal politicians, but it's total horse shit because people do disagree with them regularly. Let's use that comment you linked as an example, not only do I believe that the pro-cop ticket of biden/Harris is not a foot in the door for progressives (seeing as neither is progressive and both have very vocally opposed various progressive policies), but guess what, I've also had several redditors (I won't call them neolibs as I know that's apparently where you draw the line) tell me Joe Biden is extremely progressive.

8/14/2020,"The Hatch Act makes it illegal for a government employee to use their position, title, or rank to campaign for anyone running for office, advocate for or against any candidate for office over another, to otherwise publicly denigrate or disparage political opponents, or to make public statements for or against anyone running for office while they are on White House grounds, with specific exceptions made for the President and Vice President. The reasoning touches on a lot of things, but a couple standouts are that 1. A person within the current administration enjoys greater access to media and a ready platform priority while carrying all the authority of the US government when they make statements, and 2. Our tax dollars fund the government, entirely, and that includes the salaries of the people serving currently. While on official business for the United States government, it is illegal to then use that time to instead work in campaign business, because why would a voter want their money being used to potentially fund the reelection of a president they don’t want re-elected. This is a law that has existed and been enforced for the last 80 years of our country, has been upheld twice by the Supreme Court, and enjoyed congresses bi-partisan modernization updates in 2012. So, it’s a good law, that all three branches have upheld and complied with on both sides. 

Across the 8 years of the Obama administration, the law was violated TWICE, and in both instances the violations were as minor as one sentence expressing a hope that Obama gets re-elected. But Obama’s administration has zero tolerance for this and in both instances the president had the violators reimburse the taxpayers for the time and travel and any other extraneous expenses found to even be questionable. And in both instances the individuals were almost fired. 

All that is to say that, under the Trump administration, JUST Kellyanne Conway, a single employee of This President, has violated the hatch act 27 times, with the investigator (a Republican) officially informing the president in writing of her criminality 8 times, and in the first time ever had a panel called where they recommended her immediate firing.

Jared has a further 9 violations and Ivanka has another 3, and 12 other administration officials have had documented violations that are currently under investigation.

A nihilist says don't vote or that it doesn't matter which you vote for.  It matters very much which of those two individuals you vote for.

No.  Actually, that is exactly how it has become so popular.

It is not about giving up on them.  I want Medicare 4 all.  I am just realistic about the fact that neither of the two candidates on the ballot will either work for let alone deliver such a thing.  Instead, I will continue to push for Meidcare 4 all with other candidates and work hard to primary candidates who are against Medicare 4 All.

The public option was removed by one of the DEMOCRATIC senators in Connecticut as an appeal to his more conservative voter base and to republicans in the house and senate.

He still is in the negative when it comes to if people actually like him. Polling well against trump doesn’t mean people like Biden, it just means they like trump less. It does nothing to change Biden’s garbage history in politics.

And I don’t support a public option. Single payer is the only way to remotely salvage the healthcare system in the US, anything less just leaves open the dismantling of the public option which we all know is exactly what will happen if it was to be implemented (it won’t, not under trump or under Biden).

Don’t try to pretend like obama did nothing wrong by building detention centers. He built them for this purpose and they’re being used. Those concentration camps should never have been built in the first place bc that’s what they’ve always been. 

Joe has the political capital to accomplish these policies? I sure did see him fight hard for the Democratic Party to make any progressive policy part of the party platform.

He’s not going to accomplish any of the things he says he supports bc he doesn’t actually support them and neither does the Democratic Party.

Accusations does not mean guilty.

&gt;As for Biden’s “mental health issues”

Trump aced the mental acuity test and when don lemon and cuomo mocked him about it and took the test themselves don couldnt tell the difference between a rhino and a hippo. I think joe biden should take it as well since i think he has dementia. The dude forgets where hes at, whos his sister, cornpop, racist comments like poor kids are just as talented as white kids, forgetting the word god, saying 150 million people die to gun violence every year and much more. 

&gt;You think Trump, the man who banned Black people from living in

Yes he date a black lady named kara young for 2 years. If trump is a racist then he would believe that she is below her so why even date? He won the discrimination case and the time that it allegedly happen was when Fred Trump was running the operation. As for the mexican comment he was referring to illegal immigration and how some of them are rapists, drug dealers and human traffickers. Are all illegal immigrants bad? Of course not. Under the trump administration black unemployment hit an all time low. So if trump is a racist he is the worst racist ever in being racist. 

&gt;Who repeatedly denied Obama was American (and now repeating that same trope with Harris)


I dont think trump started the conversation of harris not being american. That would be an opinion piece by newsweek i believe and trump isnt pushing it to my knowledge. As for Obama yes he did say he wasnt an american citizen however that doesnt make someone a racist.

&gt;Hillary is not in jail

&gt;

That was more of a joke i thought since the rich and powerful elites in this world never go to jail unless they REALLY fuck up.

&gt;Who runs 2.5/3 branches of government

Not the democrats. Its more like 1.5 since GOP controls executive, half of the legislative and SCOTUS is suppose to not be bias so once appointed political affiliations are supposed to be cut. However that isnt a rule and is more of a culture thing than anything else. 

&gt;America is far from great and being laughed at, shunned or pittied by the world. 

OMG people from a different country have an unfavorable opinion of the US who gives a fuck. Man that makes me completely rethink my decision about trump that people from different countries believe that someone else should be president. 

&gt;Kapernick a “son of a bitch”

I dont because he didnt single anyone out. During a speech he called anyone who kneels and disrespects the flag a son of a bitch. Personally i agree with trump since many men have died so you can kneel for the flag. Especially kapernick since if it wasnt for union soldiers sacrifices, the horrible practice of slavery would still be here to do this likely. 

&gt;But didn’t say boo when white larpers took over a state legislature with automatic weapons?

They were most likely semi automatics since automatic guns are insanely hard to get. Their are 270 million guns in america and only 630 thousand are automatic. Also they literally can do this thanks to 1a and 2a. While removing confederate statues is removing history unless it was after the civil war in my opinion.

8/13/2020,"What? You're putting words in my mouth.

I don't think he's fascist, I never said nor implied that. I'm a firm believer in health policy enforcement, despite being conservative-leaning, but my primary concern is his informal actions and opinions. All he does is shield his ego (as do many politicians) and refuse to take responsibility for his failures to control COVID-19 in America.

I would be happy to detail his failures and lies concerning COVID-19, but here are two articles that cover some of the points I'm concerned with.

[The Atlantic on Trump's lies about COVID-19](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/) (Last updated July 13)

[NY Times on some of Trump's failures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html) (Last updated July 28)

Yes, there is a bias in the media. I know. But these are undeniable failures of Trump and his admin.

He has been passive with his promotion of mask use to the point that only [52% of Republicans](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/) (June 2020) believe that masks should be worn always/most of the time. On the other hand, 86% of Democrats believe the same. Even scarier, 9% of Republicans, according to the same polling, believe masks should never be worn as opposed to the &lt;1% of Democrats. Yikes.

He praises governors like Kemp (I'm from Georgia, I'm experiencing this first hand) who sought legal punishment of Mayor Bottoms for enforcing reasonable public health policy on businesses. As he praises politicians aligned with him, he has attacked Joe Biden for safely socially distancing at his rallies while not enforcing social distancing and masks at his rallies. That's absurd.

Furthermore, his claim that the high number of cases is caused by high rates of testing does ***nothing*** for fighting COVID-19 as it doesn't take away from the fact that there's a high number of cases. Instead of focusing on such fruitless nuances, he should be making policies that support at-risk populations and social-distancing. He has done little to do so aside from permitting states and business to implement such policies. At the very least, he should be actively promoting such policies on a regular basis, but he does not.

If this doesn't do it for you, a well-recognized but ***optimistic*** model ([IHME](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)) for COVID-19 that has been one of the primary models used by the Trump Administration predicts 300,000 deaths by December 1st with daily deaths hovering around 1000-1500 for August through October. We never came close to flattening the curve.

Now on the topic of the anti-racism protests. A distinction *must* be made between anti-racism and Black Lives Matter the organization, [as the organization does not represent the majority of protesters](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/black_lives_matter_the_movement_the_organization_and_how_journalists_get_it_wrong.php). The minority of violent protesters has taken advantage of the anonymity and social cohesion to pursue chaos and crime, where the rest have peacefully stood up for what they believe in. There are bad apples in law enforcement just as there are bad apples in groups of protesters. Was it wrong of protesters in Atlanta, Chicago, and Portland to trash public property? Yes. But instead of amplifying the voices of peaceful protesters, Trump minimized protesting as a whole by making threats. The Fed should be employed where violence and looting is taking place, but there is no doubt that they and other law enforcement have overstretched by gassing and [taking violent measures against peaceful protester](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/police-keep-using-force-against-peaceful-protesters-prompting-sustained-criticism-about-tactics-and-training/2020/06/03/5d2f51d4-a5cf-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html)s. A few families I know in [Charlotte were cornered and gassed](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/politics/cmpd-to-review-incident-protesters-trapped-gassed/275-39314f9a-a4af-4a69-9dc4-661a4ee57d5b) for peacefully protesting through the evening and past curfew (Yes, it was likely unintentional, but they should have been more careful). I understand that a curfew is a law that has consequences, but let's not pretend that staying past curfew justified an arrest and, in some cases, violence.

8/11/2020,"The issue is though, people simply do not care. Don’t misread what I am saying, I believe 100% that Donald Trump should be tried for crimes. He’s done a horrible job of “leading” the country through the pandemic. 

I also agree that it would do well to remind the world — and future POTUS’ — that the POTUS cannot do whatever he or she desires. 

However, I still believe that jailing someone like Trump would cause such a disruption to society, the U.S. might not recover. At a certain point, it’s best to remove the man from office by voting him out or impeaching him.

I don’t take offense at your point regarding Eastern Europe. The U.S. is not Eastern Europe, and perhaps it’s because there are discussions like the one we are having now; our politicians are corrupt but not THAT corrupt. Nonetheless, America has had its moments; think of McCarthyism, the Red Scare, and blacklists. That was one form of opposition that was silenced by the establishment — with and without public trials of varying legitimacy. It is possible for it to happen here. 

I am convinced that if Joe Biden wins, Donald Trump will shadow him on Twitter and the GOP will jump at any opportunity for investigations only because the Democrats did it to Trump and his supporters will call for their congressmen to get back at the Democrats. I hope I’m wrong but I believe this type of partisanship is most likely to occur and it is a cancer growing within our country.",-0.0286

And the evidence in her favor is stronger than that of Dr. Ford’s. She has several people corroborating her story saying that they heard her tell them about it in the mid 90’s like Reade’s former neighbor, LaCasse. She is a Biden supporter who came out in support of her story because she thought the media was treating her poorly. Even Tara Reade’s mother called onto Steven King to ask how a staffer could report a scandal against a senator in the same year as the incident. That’s way too coincidental. If this is a lie then she has been keeping up this lie for 27 years and she has told several people about it within the 90’s and some in the early 2000’s.

8/13/2020,"I got sick of the main stream media protecting the left and making every single thing a negative thing about Trump. Covid and George Floyd really brought that all to light.

If anyone is really a racist, it is Joe Biden. Trump has his base but he's actually done a lot for black Americans, where as Joe Biden has compared poor kids to white kids, called integrated schools a Jungle, and taken for granted black people and their vote. 

Obamacare, which I have, is expensive as F. My premium has gone up like crazy. I want it replaced. Anyone that says ACA is a good thing, is a fool and must not have it.

Covid was mishandled by everyone, including governors. Living in NYC, I am sick of seeing Cuomo praised for his leadership. He told Deblasio Manhattan would never be shut down after Deblasio said it might need to be. He had a state guideline forcing seniors to go back to nursing homes while covid+, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths. He played games with Trump by holding our state reopening hostage and ultimate lost in trying to get federal funding and now we have small businesses closing left and right. 

Closing our borders until the end of the year as an executive order was done to force businesses to rehire Americans instead of foreigners since covid created high unemployment. Yet, the media want to call this racist. The executive order states all of this clearly and I think its a good idea. 

No one disagrees that George Floyd should not have died. Yet we have democratic leaders pretending everyone is peacefully protesting while I look out the window and see people breaking windows with bats and looting. The DA that dropped the hammer on the two police officers that were part of the Rayshard Brooks death was in a run off at the time. The video speaks for itself. He also just lost his run off. Yet, democratic leaders again, let riots and looting go on and people making excuses for them. Same with Portland, the live streams speak for themselves...the video footage the media will never show. And Chicago three nights ago. 

The media tries to portray all of this as Trumps fault. A year ago, I would have believed them. Now, I see the truth and I no longer support anything on the left right now. They need to figure out what they're really about and stop trying to lie to the American people.

From the article.

WASHINGTON – It was one of the few issues on which President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden disagreed: how far to go in limiting the influence of lobbyists in government.

Biden privately complained that his boss’ effort to slam shut the revolving door between K Street and the administration would deprive it of experienced talent, and he bristled when Obama’s aides tried to block him from hiring a well-connected Washington operator who had lobbied for pharmaceutical and insurance companies, credit agencies and others.

Eight years later, that same confidant, Steve Ricchetti, is helping to run Biden’s presidential campaign. Also involved to varying degrees are other advisers, operatives, fundraisers and allies with deep connections to Washington’s lucrative lobbying, communications and strategic consulting industry.

That puts Biden at odds with powerful elements of his party’s liberal base. Increasingly, they are expressing concern that the military contractors, Wall Street banks and other major corporations that paid members of Biden’s inner circle while they were out of government could hold disproportionate power in a Biden administration.",-0.0277

https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/8/12/1968702/-Hannity-hands-Trump-a-softball-question-about-Kamala-Harris-and-Trump-loses-his-mind

I'm just going to post the entirety of this conversation where he can't even answer the question let along make any sense:

The conversation was obviously supposed to be about Kamala Harris being chosen for the Biden ticket. Hannity’s job on Fox News was clearly supposed to be to attack Harris and Joe Biden, talk about Harris and Biden’s arguments about race, and let Trump win the day. Instead, Trump said this: [Important note: All punctuation here consists of guesses by the author as Trump doesn’t exactly … well, you know.]

“Well, first of all, what you said about Russia: The New York Times is fake reporting, it’s a fake newspaper as far as I’m concerned, and Washington Post likewise. I always try to figure out which is worse. And then you have CNN and frankly ABC, CBS, NBC, and, but you have some good ones in between. Locals are great. Locals we do great in, but couldn’t possibly be here and on social media. I don’t, does anybody do better, in terms of importance of social media? So we get the word out.”

Let’s just take a breather. That’s literally 1/6th of Trump’s breathy, uninterrupted ramble. From here Trump says that there are good journalists who know that Russia was a “hoax,” and then he begins to attack the Pulitzer Prize.

“And a lot of our Congress and Senate, they got it right and they got it wrong, and they got Pulitzer Prizes. The Pulitzer Prize is worthless as far as I’m concerned because when you have the Maggie Habermans getting a Pulitzer Prize and she got it all wrong, she doesn’t. I haven’t spoken to her in forever, she’s like my biographer, like she knows everything about me. She knows nothing about me.”

Let’s take another breather. Trump then goes back into Russia being a hoax and then mentions he didn’t think Susan Rice would have been the vice presidential pick, being she was a part of the hoax. It must be pointed out that technically, the Rice mention is tangentially connected to the Hannity question in that Harris is the vice presidential pick, and Rice was someone people speculated was being considered. Then Trump repeats that this was all a scandal and a hoax and finishes with his newfound fixation on the Pulitzer Prize.

“But these writers, the writers got Pulitzer Prizes, and that shows you a Pulitzer Prize is worthless. And frankly, you ought to start a petition to return the Pulitzer Prize because they were all wrong. They were wrong on this one. The whole subject of Russia Russia Russia was made up, fabricated. It was a crime that was committed, and you look at Hillary Clinton where she paid for the fake dossier, and now the dossier is proven to be totally fake. It’s a disgrace what happened and no other president should have to go through it, Sean.”

Sean, like the bag of dead souls he is, takes Trump’s Russia hoax finish and just regurgitates it back in what is arguably one of the most pathetically groveling performances I’ve ever listened to in my life. Trump is terrified and the only thing he knows is that his base likes hearing him attacking Comey and giving lip service to some faint QAnon conspiracy theory about the world being controlled by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.",-0.0272
8/12/2020,"Every single selection? I would not necessarily disagree with that in that candidates generally choose their vp based off identity. Again though, we're not talking about a situation where privately a candidate chose their candidate based on identity. It is definitely a stupid reality that if Obama had chosen a black or other person of non-white descent and that if had, he might have lost that election. Once again though, that's not what we're talking about. Ahead of time before he had even chosen his candidate, Biden had decided to turn the VP pick into a publicity stunt by announcing he would only pick a woman for president. Obama didn't come out six months before picking Biden saying that he was going to pick a white person as VP or anything. If Kamala Harris had been chosen like most VP candidates it probably wouldn't bother me as much, I still dislike her as a candidate mind you.

Also, why are you trying to make the argument that I am racist? Just because somebody is criticizing a person of color that doesn't automatically make them racist (granted, I understand that, that specific argument has often been made by actual racists, so I get your point). Want a list of recent horrible white male vice presidents? Mike Pence has a horrible track record on gay rights, Dick Cheney was one of many republican figureheads pushing all those wars in the mid aughts (which came with the Abu Ghraib relevations), Al Gore has some sexual assault allegations, oh and also Joe Biden, who as I mentioned previously, also has sexual assault allegations, has worked with segregationists and voted with those wars under George W. Bush. I can't really say much about other previous vice presidents, since I don't know as much belong those that eventually became president like Andrew Johnson - who, also was awful.

The first woman to assume office of either vice president, or president shouldn't just be a publicity stunt manufactured by the party they represent. I disagree heavily with Obama's platform as it is very similar to Joe Biden's and he only agreed to re-define marriage once it got popular, but he was elected because he gained gradual support from the base and overtook Hillary Clinton.

8/17/2020,"There is no lies in the article.  Its sad you are so politically biased that you cannot tolerate a poignant criticism of the Biden campaign. 

Since you didn't read it I will explain for others who are reading the comments

- Biden is running a very limited exposure, scripted campaign

- Biden campaign is refusing the media to ask any questions so its literally propaganda.  The media is also mostly quiet and very tolerant of Joe not allowing questions and also having very limited engagements.  Trump, for all his faults, does not shy from questions and makes clear his intentions.

- Biden used the corona virus to shade his campaign by hiding in his basement.  Now that he is finally out his team has resorted to controlling media encounters through limited interactions and no questions allowed.

- kamala became the VP pick but was not on the Sunday political shows.  Its looking apparent that her exposure to critical questions is also highly restricted.  Bernie was sent out to the Sunday shows as the Democrat surrogate

Personally I see it as a winning formula for Joe and so does the article.   Joe is one to say very odd and questionable things.  Like saying African Americans aren't black if they don't vote Democrat.  Saying kids need to listen to the record player to have better behaviors.  Insisting you can't go into a 7-11 without seeing an Indian.  Poor kids are just as bright as white kids.  Asking recently a black reporter if he used cocaine and was a junkie as a retort to if he had cognitive tests.   I'm tired of the Trump bully tactics.  Its poor character and unpresidential.  He is crude, insensitive,  and abrasive.  But I'm also wary of a secret presidency of a very old man battling senility.  50% of Democrats don't even think Joe will make it through the full 4 years.

Millions are bankrupted by healthcare expenses and people are crippled by student loan debt (which he doesn’t want to forgive). Shit goes on and on and on dude.

I've told him that whilst DJT is the president, more than half of voters backed HRC at the last election. Is it logical to think that she could be taken to Gitmo and summarily executed? Well, even if she *were* guilty of a crime, US civilians can't be tried by anyone outside the civil court system, that includes military tribunals. Execution? Well, the death penalty is a contentious issue for most and I can't see people just accepting something like that. You used the word 'fantasy', which is exactly what this is: somebody indulging their personal sick fantasies in an online game of Dungeons and Dragons. And the timeline is getting a bit old now.

8/16/2020,"So first I’d just like to point out that the idea of “tearing it all down” is not the idea held by the majority of progressive people. It is a radical idea, and while a lot of media outlets like to make it SEEM like it’s the commonly held belief of the left, it’s not. And if you want proof of that just look at the fact that many more people voted for Joe Biden than Bernie or Warren in the primary and Joe’s whole stance has been “let’s not get too crazy here, I can beat Trump”. 

But on the idea of whether or not systemic racism exists, just for one example about one aspect of society I would say give the documentary “13th” a watch on Netflix. The 13th amendment made slavery illegal, except for prisoners. The amendment itself SPECIFICALLY states “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States”. And to use that loophole immediately after it was passed you started having laws about not being allowed to be outside if you were not employed (it sounds crazy but that’s real) and who wasn’t employed after slavery had just ended? The very poor white people and the newly freed slaves. Then, to this day, black and Latino men often receive prison sentences that are multiple times as long as white men for non-violent drug-related charges. These men then go to jail and are slave labor for a number of companies in the United States. Until they were called out recently even Victoria’s Secret used prison labor to make their underwear. 

In this case it isn’t necessarily that there is a secret mandate to all judges to say “hey, give the black guys more prison time” but there are so many social factors in play there that contribute to thinking “black man bad” that the same result ends up happening. And then you say “well that’s just the result of some bad actors being racist, not a systemic problem” but the systemic issues are what’s causing them to be racist in the first place. If even a 4th of judges are unconsciously more likely to give a black guy a longer sentencing for a nonviolent crime that’s not fixable by just “rooting out some bad apples”, that’s a systemic-scale problem.

Then, because black and Latino men get incarcerated more for the same crime and the vast majority of prisoners are now black and Latino you have the conception of “the criminal” as being a person of color, because more likely than not a person in prison will be a person of color. Then on top of that you have a higher proportion of POC children who grow up at least partially with no dad because he’s in prison. That’ll fuck a kid up. And now you have the next generation already being affected by the things that affected their parents and it just keeps on spinning around and around.

And that’s just the case of higher sentencing for non-violent crimes. I highly recommend you watch 13th, they give stats and sources throughout and it truly changed how i thought about the prevalence of systemic racism.",-0.0237
8/17/2020,"SHADOWGATE: THE DOCUMENTARY

BY MILLENIAL MILLIE (MILLIE WEAVER)


They arrested the journalist who made the documentary.

The documentary is a combination of research and interviews with whistleblowers.

The whistleblowers worked for the government agencies making the software used to spy.

They said that Washington DC has a program owned by General Jim Jones' company.

The ShadowNet is demographic analysis program that is fed all the potential jurors for every Washington DC case.

The program pulls the names of people called for jury duty.

It classifies candidates according to hundreds of aspects of their lives (including social post history) to predict how they will vote the issues when on a jury.

The jury pool is thus a collection of candiates all of whom will vote one way.

They will either vote to convict or vote to acquit, depending on the needs of the lawyers using the program.

This is, of course, insanely illegal and immoral.

General Jim Jones is in the Atlantic Council. 

These are the people who completely freaked the fuck out when Trump called Ukraine.

It was not the alleged quid pro quo they were freaked about.

It was the request for the Crowdstrike information.

They freaked because Trump's question indicated he knew that Crowdstrike was at the epicenter of the fake material the FBI used to forge FISA warrant requests.

They wrote the dossier that they fed to Buzzfeed that the news then confirmed by asking themselves if they believed it was real.

The work of fiction made its way to the impeachment.

If anyone cared about quid pro quo, then Joe Biden would be in jail for holding up a billion dollars until Ukraine president fired the prosecutor investigating Burisma, the corrupt company that Hunter Biden joined as a board member.

The billion dollars Trump held up was not for Ukraine defense.

It was a billion dollars of USA taxpayer money that would land in Ukraine and then be distributed back to the players.

The players being Biden, Biden's son, the Atlantic Council, Obama (I'm getting fuzzy on remembering these details).

This is why they freaked out while wiretapping Trump's call to Ukraine.

Eric Ciaramella didn't overhear Trump's non-speakerphone conversation from across the room.

The call was wiretapped and they put Ciaramella in the whistleblower position for the impeachment.

There's a huge amount in the documentary about the contractors who setup the false flags, I think they're IIA, and Jim Jones is a part of that too.

Black Lives Matter is a psyop designed to divide the country before the election.

The Corona virus is a psyop designed to crash the economy before the election.

They hate Trump because he's a nationalist.

They are globalists who want to concentrate power at the top of a pyramid.

The post itself starts with a link to the Austin Police Association and claims it as fact. The APA is led by the guy that went on Fox News to say the protester that was shot dead in Austin deserved it and also told Austin Police officers that they should slow down their work rate to punish the Austin City Council 

It also includes a link to a Sinclair station in Austin with a right wing bias.

It also includes a link to a story about APD officers leaving that has the officers leaving at a higher rate prior to April and less after that but yet OP tries to make you think it's because of the funding debate.

8/21/2020,"&gt;We are former national security officials who served during the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and/or Donald Trump, or as Republican Members of Congress. We are profoundly concerned about the course of our nation under the leadership of Donald Trump. Through his actions and his rhetoric, Trump has demonstrated that he lacks the character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in corrupt behavior that renders him unfit to serve as President.

&gt;For the following reasons, we have concluded that Donald Trump has failed our country and that Vice President Joe Biden should be elected the next President of the United States:

&gt;​1) Donald Trump has gravely damaged America’s role as a world leader.

&gt;​2) Donald Trump has shown that he is unfit to lead during a national crisis.

&gt;3) Donald Trump has solicited foreign influence and undermined confidence in our presidential elections.

&gt;4) Donald Trump has aligned himself with dictators and failed to stand up for American values. 

&gt;5) Donald Trump has disparaged our armed forces, intelligence agencies, and diplomats. 

&gt;6) Donald Trump has undermined the rule of law. 

&gt;7) Donald Trump has dishonored the office of the presidency.

&gt;8) Donald Trump has divided our nation and preached a dark and pessimistic view of America. 

&gt;9) Donald Trump has attacked and vilified immigrants to our country. 

&gt;10) Donald Trump has imperiled America’s security by mismanaging his national security team.

&gt;While we – like all Americans – had hoped that Donald Trump would govern wisely, he has disappointed millions of voters who put their faith in him and has demonstrated that he is dangerously unfit to serve another term.

&gt;In contrast, we believe Joe Biden has the character, experience, and temperament to lead this nation. We believe he will restore the dignity of the presidency, bring Americans together, reassert America’s role as a global leader, and inspire our nation to live up to its ideals.

&gt;While some of us hold policy positions that differ from those of Joe Biden and his party, the time to debate those policy differences will come later. For now, it is imperative that we stop Trump’s assault on our nation’s values and institutions and reinstate the moral foundations of our democracy.

&gt;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.

8/13/2020,"First, I agree with you about the Joe Biden. He is an establishment democrat and will not bring about the change our country desperately needs and that belief was solidified by the Harris VP pick. But whether you like it or not, either Trump or Biden is going to be the next president (barring some bizarre turn of events). You voting 3rd party isn’t going to change that.

So for me the election is between voting for an underwhelming candidate and an ignorant bigot. I’ll take the underwhelming candidate every time. Not because I necessarily support Biden but because Donald Trump is dangerous to our country.

The reason why I believe all 3rd party voters should vote progressive is because for (for the sake of this argument) a libertarian to make a serious run at president, fundamental reform to how our country’s campaigns and elections are ran is needed. I’m talking about rank choice voting. I’m talking about eliminating lobbying. Eliminating the DNC and the RNC. Eliminating gerrymandering. Allowing 3rd party candidates a platform to be seen on a national stage.

Republicans will NEVER support that because their entire strategy is too suppress votes and mobilize their voters using single issue buttons like abortion. The problem is establishment dems don’t want these changes either. It’s a threat to both party’s power so to me the question is who will bring about this change? This is why I’ll never judge people for voting libertarian (or 3rd party in general) for down ballot nominees because they have a chance.

But a 3rd party candidate hasn’t a chance in hell to win the presidency without major changes to the entire election process being made which is why I’ll be voting for Biden because pretty much anybody is better than the hate filled ignoramus that is our president at the moment.

8/21/2020,"Here’s something that rightists struggle to understand: Shafran’s article IS partisan, and it SHOULD be partisan. This is because, unfortunately, human decency has become a partisan issue. And he’s absolutely right to point it out.

One side is objectively wrong and cultish. The article points this out quite clearly if you read between the lines. Mods, ban me if you want, but you know this is true. Republicans under Trump have abandoned human decency, and unfortunately a sizable portion of Orthodoxy (some, not all) has bought into Trumpist propaganda. They have abandoned decency for the sake of realpolitik bs.

He’s hinting, without even a degree of subtlety,[ that he will not leave office if he loses](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-election-results-white-house/). This is fascism, and a significant segment of America, along with much of the frum community, has bought into it without reservation. The fact that people see no problem with the degree of politician worship in the video is incredibly worrying. 

Trump and his Republican enablers are bad, and the alternative, at least by comparison, is not. And this is coming from someone who is NO FAN of Joe Biden. I can see truth with my own eyes. No amount of gaslighting will make me ignore it. Jews must not vote for Donald Trump or the Republicans. They must vote Democrat instead, all down the ticket. The survival of democracy depends on it. I am not being hyperbolic in the slightest.

One may dismiss criticism of Shewkey’s song as being against “hakaras hatov”, but take a look at the thing. Can anyone look at that video and honestly believe it is anything other than pure cultism and avoda zara? Nobody would make a suckup video like that for Hillary Clinton, or any other boring politician, and you KNOW it. Trump is not a standard politician. He attracted a cult following with his personality, and his empty gestures towards Israel have unfortunately corrupted the minds of many Jews. The author is completely right to point out how far we have fallen as a people, and in such a short time. We’re going down the wrong path.

Jewish Trump supporters: I have to be careful with my words here because mods still believe in the “both sides” fallacy. Trump is not your friend. Eventually, when he runs out of people to scapegoat, he’ll come for you too.  One side is objectively wrong and fascist, the other is not. Look at what’s going on. Read the news; real news, not news that is propagandized towards pro-Trump views.

Because we quite literally don't agree upon the same reality. Trump is the real threat; not antifa. 

The propaganda you consume doesn't tell the truth; instead it substitutes actual reality with the one it constructed. All the propaganda does is keep you ignorant and your mind closed. You're trapped in a bubble of falsehood and misguided hate.

Avoid Fox News, Breitbart, Infowars, Drudge, and other such outlets. Publicly funded sources like NPR or the BBC are better. Or Reuters. You can an research an outlet’s general credibility [here](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com).

As President, he will redouble these efforts to ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services.

&gt;Yes, I, a Muslim American immigrant who makes about 70K a year and still has student debt (courtesy of Joe Biden's legislation that makes my student loans follow me around for the rest of my life) am privileged.

Yes, making 70k a year certainly makes you privleged, whether or not you have student loan debt, and I'm guessing declaring bankruptcy isn't actually something you want to do - though I am guessing the 10k in annual student loan forgiveness Biden is calling for would be helpful to you. But just to be clear, your salary puts you in the 74th percentile of Americans. That's absolutely a privleged position.",-0.0217

Every day he's going to have to make a speech to the public (as COVID continues to rage and the economy is in the absolute shitter) and it will sound exactly like the Felix Biederman immitation. Under Biden we will see a Democratic party completely discredited because it will be ideologically and materially incapable of dealing with the enormous challenges the US will face, and will continue to push unpopular and totally incompetent adventurist imperialism. And unlike the Obama era, there won't be a magnetic charisma to cover it up and unlike the Trump era there won't be a repulsive freak to credibly use as a disciplinary tool on the population. The population has already survived what  they've been told is the worst case scenario (Trump) and now they're going to be in such a horrific situation that they'll demand better than what Biden can offer and no amount of identitarian scolding or scaremongering can avoid the inevitable dissilusionment that'll come with having Joe fucking Biden as president.

Biden is certainly a middle of the road guy. He hasn't blazed any trails. In the 90s, when many people were afraid about crime, he supported the crime bill that most of the country also supported. In 2003, he supported the Iraq War that most of the country also supported.

He doesn't thrill me. He doesn't strike me as a person who has the clearest eye for the long-term consequences of government action.

The ground shakes as pools of bullshit begin to creep into the room. It seeps in through cracks in the doors, through secret passages behind fake bookshelves, and through the little holes drilled by Obama to spy on his conversations. It puddles at his feet and begins to rise, forming a swirling maelstrom that envelops the powerful, youthful 230 lb frame of the President.

if youd like to hear about racism, go look at kamala harris’ political career, which enforced policies that put POC in jail. joe biden is a completely out of touch neoliberal capitalist who is definitely not a “champion of the poor”. and he certainly isnt a champion of minorities or people of color. anyone who was certainly wouldnt pick kamala harris as VP, someone who would be a huge risk to their credibility. 

looking past the creepy hair sniffing antics, biden is center left, neoliberal and thus is definitely pro capitalist. nothing inherently wrong with that, but do you think someone who has strongly supported law enforcement in the past (and clearly does now, with kamala harris as his VP pick) is going to fare well among voters during the current political climate in this country, where there are protests over the killings of innocent black people and cries to defund the police? 

at best, biden is going to be a do nothing president. someone who is going to be spending a lot of their time picking up the pieces of the corona pandemic and possibly reversing trump policies concerning taxing the rich. he’ll make headway in that respect, but he isnt going to do anything big like ACA. he definitely wont defund or heavily reorganize the police; perhaps he’ll help propose a law that will do nothing to stop the killings.

i dont blame anyone for not wanting to vote for “not trump”. just because biden is slightly better doesnt make a difference. it wont actually be that much better in the long term, and that is the issue. trying to take the moral high ground AGAIN four years later and basically forcing people into voting biden or nothing is pretty despicable.",-0.0179

Look at Joe Biden, he said if a black person doesn’t vote for him, they are not black. Imagine Trump saying that and the field day they would have, but since it’s a mainstream opinion  and Black people “should” vote Democrat it’s okay to say, and to consider Black people a monolith is racist.

Joe Biden's cognitive decline doesn't concern me in the least as to being president because Democrats in general rely  on experts instead of going by instinct and impulse. Joe is definitely not an angry bitter, crazy old person, he might not be as sharp as he once was, but he still has a lot of knowledge and wisdom, and experience to make use of in the leadership role. As to whether Joe is in significantly declined such that he messes up in the debates and loses because of it, that is possibly.
 having watched the primary debates, I have a lot of doubt in that, and I think (and hope) you all are doing us non-Trump supporters a favor by lower the bar for Joe in the debates; so I usually ignore these arguments, let you pull your own rope. We will see in the next few weeks. 

I don't know what you said about biden being sex pest. Given that there was only one, semi legit accuser who ultimate ended showing a pattern of lies and inconsistencies, I just don't buy it. Joe also just doesn't seem like the type. 40 year, one inconsist accuser who's lawyer dropped her and no new ones will take her case, is pretty good evidence to doubt such claims

As individuals, neither one of us can assess whether the other side is more mean. If you wear a maga hat in San Francisco, you will likely be treated poorly; but I wouldn't want to wear a Biden hat in some rural town in Alabama.

Trump is going to lie about his opponents record, policies, and character. Every time he does this it's to scare away low information swing voters, and make sure right leaning moderates are too afraid of his opponent to realize how bad things are right now, and how Trump clearly has no plans to fix any of it. If the focus is on the Democratic candidate, no matter who it is, it favors Trump because it builds this equivalency where Trump's mistakes are somehow easier to swallow because everyone is shit, you can't trust anyone, and it's better the devil you know.


Biden works because he's already a known quantity. He's the goofy and boring old guy. He doesn't scare away moderate conservatives by yelling about revolution. He's not a fresh face who Trump's attack dogs can define on their own terms. He's not this bastion of morality that'll be destroyed if something less than respectable comes out (or is fabricated) about him. He's just good ol Joe. This is literally the formula to beat Trump. Pick someone as boring as possible so Trump's attacks look rediculous, and the focus stays on Trump.


Think of politics like Boxing. Biden is playing rope a dope. It's working. We're coming close to the election, and Trump looks out of ammunition.

The Central Park five were five young boys who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were accused of raping a woman in Central Park. The investigation was handled extremely unfairly and they served years in jail until they were cleared by DNA evidence.

DACA and the issue at the border, while both being related to immigration don’t really have to do with illegal immigration. For DACA, these are young people who have grown up in the US, many don’t really have much of any ties to their home countries. They pay taxes and participate in our society. They were given LEGAL protection to say in the US during the Obama administration. Trump wants to reverse that. 

As for the poor souls who have been put into cages near the southern border, it is not illegal to claim asylum. The Obama administration was processing these people at the border and releasing them with a date for their asylum review, I believe I read that in some cases they were hooked up with ankle bracelets. What’s funny is it is far, far more expensive to keep these people locked up. It’s pretty clear to me that this policy is designed to punish people for having the audacity to try to claim asylum.

Universal childcare was proposed by Bernie in the 2020 race. BIden? He wants to bail out the industry...

&gt; To help child care providers like Carreño stay afloat, many experts have called for a bailout of the child care industry, estimating that providers around the country need about $50 billion to keep paying their expenses amid lower revenues and potential temporary closures. Now presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has made such a bailout part of a larger proposal — which also includes provisions to boost workers’ pay and strengthen their power to unionize — to help America’s caregivers.

Bernie forgives all loans and guarantees tuition and debt-free public colleges, universities, HBCUs, Minority Serving Institutions and trade-schools to all. 

He also plans on doing a lot with DACA

 

* Institute a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete.
* Reinstate and expand DACA and develop a humane policy for those seeking asylum.
* Completely reshape and reform our immigration enforcement system, including breaking up ICE and CBP and redistributing their functions to their proper authorities.
* Dismantle cruel and inhumane deportation programs and detention centers and reunite families who have been separated.
* Live up to our ideals as a nation and welcome refugees and those seeking asylum, including those displaced by climate change

8/19/2020,"&gt; Forget gentle election-year slogans of old like “Working for Change” or “Restore Our Future.” Trump Sucks and He’s Ruining Everything! was the theme of the two-hour, COVID-era virtual production, dedicated to elevating Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, by weaponizing the litany of mistakes made by Trump.

&gt; Needless to say, the party had plenty of ammo in its arsenal and employed big guns to launch the televised attack.

...

&gt; Khizr Khan, father of slain Gold Star soldier Humayun Khan, spoke for Virginia. Khan and his wife, Ghazala, who are Muslim, were demeaned by Trump after speaking at the 2016 DNC. It was an ugly chapter, even in Trump’s Muslim-bashing legacy, so Khan’s participation Tuesday — after a brief cameo Monday night — was clearly meant to send a message: Intolerance will not be tolerated. “Three years ago my beloved city, Charlottesville, [Va.], was attacked by white supremacists and a young woman was killed,” he said. “We were attacked again when Donald Trump praised those racists, turning his back on a community that just wanted peace. That was the day Joe Biden decided to join this battle for the soul of America. Over time Ghazala and I have come to know his soul. He’s a decent, passionate man who will bring this nation together.”

...

&gt; “When this president goes overseas, it’s not a goodwill mission, it’s a blooper reel,” said former senator and Secretary of State John F. Kerry. “He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at.”",-0.0162

There isn’t if you’re working class or non-American, two groups middle class voters are perfectly willing to sacrifice for the sake of whatever dwindling concessions they receive from the capitalist class.

&gt; unless you are actively working to incite revolution by organizing the working class, which you may be, the attitude you have is one of privilege.

This is a meaningless buzzword argument that comes directly from the DNC and is laundered by people “privileged” enough to not already be totally alienated from the US electoral process. The majority of working Americans do not vote, the majority of non-whites do not vote; US politics is entirely a game for the middle class to try gaining concessions and the capitalist class to cut benefits and legally increase exploitation. That the DNC, in absence of any form of platform actually worth voting for has to guilt and shame people with lurid images of a nightmarish dictatorship that they would totes not ever institute is proof of how fucking worthless they are and how far past the point of saving the US political system is if it was ever salvageable to begin with. 

&gt; It's an attitude that basically implies you have the luxury to think the way you do, when many people in this country will be materially affected by the outcome of this election

No it means I don’t live in the world the upper middle class does where the outcome of this election will make a tangible difference in my life. I don’t know what could be more absurd than some upper middle class liberal scolding a working class person about how privileged they are for not voting for someone that’s already stated they will institute even *more* austerity, increase the overseas military engagements, increase military tensions with Russia and China, continue the barbaric policing methods used on the poor and oppressed, and increase fossil fuel exploitation.

&gt;The ACA sucks, but an expansion of it as compared to its continued erosion does help people. Ole Joe vibin is going to do fuck-all to erode the profits of his wealthy investors, but literally anything done on climate change in this critical time is markedly better for every-day americans than denial/moving the other way.

The ACA *does* suck and odds are there won’t even be an expansion or public option. And he’s already gotten rid of his “pledge” to end fossil fuel subsidies, which means extraction and burning will expand as it always has. You folks have nothing but lies now, huh?

&gt;Yeah, he'll still dronestrike innocent civilians to make sure we have oil--any capitalist sucks and I hate the position we are in. But there is a clear choice if you care about human wellbeing. Your comment says that your leftism is rooted not in the wellbeing of people but in anger or some aesthetic.

Wow, it is...utterly fascinating to watch American leftists simultaneously admit someone will massacre non-Americans overseas for the sake of US imperialism, then claim that *not* acting to put this individual in power is a product of either immature anger or “an aesthetic”. Like...the utter willingness of US “leftists” to regularly betray any notions of internationalism and betray workers in other countries for....what, the sake of someone with less reactionary *rhetoric* leading their own country? I’m immature for not being complicit in sacrificing workers overseas?

&gt;I understand the anger, trust me I have much of it too. Fuck the DNC and their role in capitalism. But to hold out in angst against pragmatic electoralism in this election, in the total lack of a revolutionary movement, is the wrong move, and is privileged.

This means nothing coming from an upper middle class American. “Pragmatic electoralism” isn’t when a bourgeois party has you by the balls for fucking decades and you’re forced to do everything they say because you can’t see through their bullshit spectacle of somehow being enemies with the only other party allowed to hold power.

Well at least kinda since other normal leftist positions like m4a is not on there... 

And if something that fundamental is missing I highly doubt there is any leftist core in that party. Especially if the party is willing to throw their goals and virtues overboard as soon as the people do not support them. 

Bernie was supported, but the party killed him of politically. There is NO trust left to the party. Dems and Reps have literally become the same. Why should an American citizen on the left vote the dems? Because of climate change? So much broken trust and even this most important issue is up on the table of broken promises. Why should someone believe that the dems actually do something against climate change? Especially do something that actually  has some value? It is a capitalist problem. No dem wants to change the system at its core. 

No, it is far more likely that after 4 more years of trump adequate change is a necessity that is unignorable. Maybe even before the second term ends.

But a Joe Biden just shows that the dems do not understand the severity of the situation. And I can fully understand that no one wants to support him, since he is a joke and a spit in the face of substantial necessary change.

It is not the left that doesn't see the problems. It's the politics that failed. Hard. Really hard. Like... They are the reason level of failing hard.

And that's how between 35% and 45% of US population actually supports Trump - not because they are blind, or stupid,  or deplorable, or irrational - but because when they look at what they value, and what's available - Trump is the better choice for them.

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday gave credence to a false and racist conspiracy about Kamala Harris’ eligibility to be president, fueling an online misinformation campaign that parallels the one he used to power his rise into politics. 

&gt; Speaking from the White House, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris, a Black woman and U.S.-born citizen whose parents were immigrants, does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious.” 

&gt; The conspiracy is false. Harris, who was tapped this week by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible to be president under the constitutional requirements. The question is not even considered complex, according to lawyers who have reviewed her circumstances. 

&gt; “Full stop, end of story, period, exclamation point,” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School. “Let’s just be honest about what it is: It’s just a racist trope we trot out when we have a candidate of color whose parents were not citizens.”

&gt; Trump built his political career on questioning a political opponent’s legitimacy. He was a high-profile force behind the so-called “birther movement” — the lie that questioned whether President Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, was eligible to serve. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.

&gt; Trump comments about Harris on Thursday landed in a blizzard of other untrue, racist or sexist claims unleashed across social media and conservative websites after Biden picked Harris, the first Black woman and the first Asian American woman on a major party ticket. The misinformation campaign is built on falsehoods that have circulating less noticeably for months, propelled by Trump and his supporters.

This is the energy I was missing. This is Joe Biden.",-0.0132
8/16/2020,"From the article:

&gt;Far from supporting harm-reducing measures — let alone progressive policies like Medicare for All or marijuana legalization — Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have consistently inflicted harm on people in the U.S. and abroad...When we proclaim that Joe Biden is the lesser of two evils, it is therefore worth asking: the lesser evil for whom? 

*

&gt;This is important to keep in mind because the history of so-called progressive reformist Democrats is paved with empty promises. With Joe Biden as his vice president, Barack Obama — the “hope and change” president — left behind a legacy that was merely a continuation of the U.S.’s capitalist, imperialist past and set the foundation for Trump’s policies. For example, despite a majority in both chambers in 2009-2010, the Obama administration implemented a business-friendly, market-based healthcare system, rather than a single-payer system. Recently, Democrats in the House and Senate have also allied with imperialist, capitalist interests by voting down a measure to defund the Pentagon by 10%, voting for stimulus acts that benefit corporations, and failing to oppose Israel’s annexation of the West Bank. Bernie Sanders, for his part, has abandoned his progressive rhetoric, and is shoring up support for the Democratic Party instead of advancing working class demands. 

*

&gt;We have seen, over and over again, that **the way to achieve social progress and get progressive policies enacted is not by working within the Democratic party which is beholden to capitalist interests. Instead of obsessively focusing on the dead-end, Sisyphean task of rolling a leftist boulder up a capitalist hill, we must build an independent political organization of the working class**. (bold added)

*

&gt;Joe Biden is highly unlikely to nominate a left-leaning justice. The Obama administration’s final Supreme Court nominee was Merrick Garland, a moderate, Republican-sympathetic judge who was more conservative on criminal justice issues than Antonin Scalia. On top of that, Biden proudly supports “reaching across the aisle” to accommodate Republicans on virtually all issues. If elected and given the opportunity to replace a Supreme Court justice, he will almost certainly nominate a moderate centrist who appeals to establishment Democrats and is palatable to Republicans. 

*

&gt;We must also acknowledge that Trump’s bigotry is often a difference in tone, rather than substance. When he called Mexicans rapists in 2015, the U.S. was implementing a Clinton-era Border Patrol policy called “Prevention through Deterrence,” forcing refugees through the desert and leading to the death of up to tens of thousands. Trump routinely makes racist comments about Native Americans, but the violent repression against the Dakota Access Pipeline protests occurred under Barack Obama, who oversaw the enormous expansion of fracking and pipelines. On anti-Chinese rhetoric, there is not even a difference in tone: Biden, in his campaign ads, tries to out-do Trump in anti-Chinese chauvinism. 

*

&gt;Joe Biden in particular has a lifelong record of racism, sexism, and homophobia. He has had a hand in creating the aforementioned criminal justice issues which he now purports to solve. Like Trump, Biden has also been accused of sexual assault, and has a documented history of inappropriately touching women...Yes, Donald Trump is racist, sexist, and anti-LGBTQ — but so is Joe Biden. Neither a Democratic nor a Republican administration will improve the material conditions for these marginalized people. 

*

&gt;It is also worth examining who Biden is currently building a base with. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, a choice which even the Wall Street Journal said is a slap in the face to progressives. Additionally, Biden has been courting donors from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the pharmaceutical industry — sectors whose profits depend on him upholding the harmful policies which he has helped create...In other words, Biden is making overtures to wealthy donors, the Democratic establishment, and even Republicans, rather than to leftists. Why would a Biden presidency be any different? 

*

&gt;Far from mobilizing the working class, self-proclaimed progressive forces working within the Democratic Party are trying to restrain it and convince us that we are powerless.  

*

&gt;Instead, we need to fight for socialism. This means fighting against both Democrats and Republicans who represent two sides of the same imperialist, capitalist coin. Left Voice has written [extensively](https://www.leftvoice.org/what-kind-of-party-do-we-need-five-international-examples) about the need for a working class party, independent of capital. Such a party would unite the working class around a revolutionary program, and coordinate protests in the streets and strikes in our workplaces.

8/20/2020,"Nothing you could type could change the facts about Biden. Your cherry picked quotes from Drumpf don't quite have the same impact 



&gt;Biden’s devastation of American workers didn’t stop there. He pushed hard to normalize trade relations between the United States and communist China, eventually voting for and leading the effort to give China “most favored nation” trade status. Once again, **Joe Biden made a prediction, saying in September 2000 that, “nor do I see the collapse of the American manufacturing economy, as China, a nation with the impact on the world economy about the size of the Netherlands', suddenly becomes our major economic competitor.” Biden was wrong again, with 3.2 million American jobs lost or displaced due to higher trade deficits with China between 2001 and 2013.**  
  


&gt;As a result of these two horrific trade decisions alone, both of which Joe Biden played a leading role in, 60,000 American factories closed and one in four manufacturing jobs were lost. This poses an obvious question — why would hardworking Ohioans ever give Joe Biden the opportunity to betray them again?

Hold gun manufacturers accountable. In 2005, then-Senator Biden voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, but gun manufacturers successfully lobbied Congress to secure its passage. This law protects these manufacturers from being held civilly liable for their products – a protection granted to no other industry. Biden will prioritize repealing this protection.

Get weapons of war off our streets. The bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that Biden, along with Senator Feinstein, secured in 1994 reduced the lethality of mass shootings. But, in order to secure the passage of the bans, they had to agree to a 10-year sunset provision and when the time came, the Bush Administration failed to extend them. As president, Biden will:

Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Federal law prevents hunters from hunting migratory game birds with more than three shells in their shotgun. That means our federal law does more to protect ducks than children. It’s wrong. Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality. While working to pass this legislation, Biden will also use his executive authority to ban the importation of assault weapons.

Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act. Currently, the National Firearms Act requires individuals possessing machine-guns, silencers, and short-barreled rifles to undergo a background check and register those weapons with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Due to these requirements, such weapons are rarely used in crimes. As president, Biden will pursue legislation to regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act.

Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines already in our communities. Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets. This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.

Reduce stockpiling of weapons. In order to reduce the stockpiling of firearms, Biden supports legislation restricting the number of firearms an individual may purchase per month to one.

Keep guns out of dangerous hands. The federal background check system (the National Instant Criminal Background Check System) is one of the best tools we have to prevent gun violence, but it’s only effective when it’s used. Biden will enact universal background check legislation and close other loopholes that allow people who should be prohibited from purchasing firearms from making those purchases. Specifically, he will:

Require background checks for all gun sales. Today, an estimated 1 in 5 firearms are sold or transferred without a background check. Biden will enact universal background check legislation, requiring a background check for all gun sales with very limited exceptions, such as gifts between close family members. This will close the so-called “gun show and online sales loophole” that the Obama-Biden Administration narrowed, but which cannot be fully closed by executive action alone. Close other loopholes in the federal background check system. In addition to closing the “boyfriend loophole” highlighted below, Biden will: Reinstate the Obama-Biden policy to keep guns out of the hands of certain people unable to manage their affairs for mental reasons, which President Trump reversed. In 2016, the Obama-Biden Administration finalized a rule to make sure the Social Security Administration (SSA) sends to the background check system records that it holds of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms because they have been adjudicated by the SSA as unable to manage their affairs for mental reasons. But one of the first actions Donald Trump took as president was to reverse this rule. President Biden will enact legislation to codify this policy.

Close the “hate crime loophole.” Biden will enact legislation prohibiting an individual “who has been convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, or received an enhanced sentence for a misdemeanor because of hate or bias in its commission” from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Close the “Charleston loophole.” The Charleston loophole allows people to complete a firearms purchase if their background check is not completed within three business days. Biden supports the proposal in the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, which extends the timeline from three to 10 business days. Biden will also direct the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to put on his desk within his first 100 days as president a report detailing the cases in which background checks are not completed within 10 business days and steps the federal government can take to reduce or eliminate this occurrence. Close the “fugitive from justice” loophole created by the Trump Administration. Because of actions by the Trump Administration, records of almost 500,000 fugitives from justice who are prohibited from purchasing firearms were deleted from the background check system. The Biden Administration will restore these records, and enact legislation to make clear that people facing arrest warrants are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms.",-0.0119

If the argument is that a party that doesn't represent you can be pulled to your side after the election... doesn't that argument work just as well for Trump?  After Trump is re-elected, why doesn't the argument work that we can pull him to the left?  Trump and Joe both don't support M4A, but only Joe can be magically pulled to the left and change his mind once we give him the only thing he needs from us?  They're both against the same progressive policies, but people will argue until they're blue in the face that it's ridiculous to expect that we could pull Trump over to our side on these issues... then take a deep breath and argue with a straight face that of course we can pull Biden after he's won.",-0.0119

Has Sanders admitted he shouldn't have signed the bill? He had a tough-on-crime stat on his page that gloated about it in the early 2000s before he took it off because he realized it wasn't popular.

**Article**:

&gt; Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are not bringing forth solutions to quell the violence erupting in cities across the country, said former NYPD Lt. Darrin Porcher.

&gt; “The elected officials have failed to produce a moratorium on the violence that has been plaguing this community and we see this happening throughout the United States,” Porcher told “Fox &amp; Friends First.”

&gt; Porcher said violence has been taking place specifically in “cities that are governed by Democratic mayors” across the United States.

&gt; “Something needs to be done. We need to reel in the violence because we’re still in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and it is essential that we utilize the resources of police for other alternatives as opposed to dealing with rioters,” Porcher said.

&gt; TRUMP SAYS NYC WAS &amp;apos;SO GOOD&amp;apos; BEFORE HE LEFT, NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE

&gt; President Trump warned New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Sunday night that the federal government would act if his office fails to get a grip on the ongoing increase of violent crime in the city.

&gt; “Law and Order,” Trump tweeted. “If @NYCMayor can’t do it, we will!”

&gt; At least five people died in shootings across the city in some 30 shootings over the weekend, Fox 5 NY reported.

&gt; Eric Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president and former NYPD captain, told the station that he is not seeing the “level of urgency that should come from the city when you have a high level of violence.”

&gt; The Fox 5 NY report said there were shootings in every borough and 43 shooting victims, 10 times the number over the same weekend in 2019.

&gt; Porcher said a “plausible solution” has not been offered in New York and other Democrat-led cities stricken with violence.

&gt; “When we look at the Democratic ticket such as Biden and Harris, they don’t appear to have a solution to ending this violence in connection with these demonstrations and so it’s just a real problem,” Porcher said.

&gt; “Therefore we have to look at what we have in office now, that being Donald Trump. I believe he is the only candidate that has a steady hand in ending the violence.”

&gt;I spoke with my friend Anisa, a progressive, woman of color and small business owner and activist. She asked that I not use her last name because business has been hard during the pandemic and she’s concerned that her political views might negatively influence her remaining clientele. Anisa chose not to vote in 2016 because she was opposed to her choices on the ballot and told me that this year, she will be doing the same thing, for the same reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The mechanism we have available to us is a sham – the candidates are chosen by the DNC or RNC, despite popular opinion (we saw this with the DNC essentially staging a coup against Bernie) and with systems in place such as voter suppression, polling place closures, redlining; it isn’t a fair system to begin with, and it’s designed to give the illusion of democracy.” She went on to say, “I do vote — I vote for all the people and policies that consider human rights — not for corporate shills. So why participate in a sham?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, Trump’s claim that [Joe Biden](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden) pushed out a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating his son’s involvement with a large private gas company was [bogus](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ukraine-john-bolton-military-aid-clinton-biden-a9572806.html). But that bogus claim doesn’t change the fact that, to me, it’s completely unacceptable that Biden helped get his son on the board of a company he had no business being on; it’s corruption, it’s nepotism, it’s elitism and it’s wrong. In my view, it's unforgivable how Biden headed up the 1991 Anita Hill hearings, his authoring of the 1994 crime legislation is responsible for our wildly disproportionate population of incarcerated Black and Latinx men, and his support for segregationists is just as inexcusable.

8/19/2020,"Former strategist to President Barack Obama, David Plouffe, told Democrats that it’s time to step up to fight back against President Donald Trump’s siege on the U.S. Postal Service.

In a list he posted over the weekend, Plouffe told Democrats to start working on primetime hearings “now,” and issue subpoenas to the Trump White House.
Speaking to MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace, Plouffe called out Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s statement that he’ll return to normal business after he attempted to slow down the mail.
“I think the DeJoy statement was a defensive PR statement,” he said. “I would consider it meaningless until we see a real change. The standard has to be whether it’s subscription drugs, Social Security check, letter to a family member or ballot, it’s delivered in the same amount of time as last year or the year before, the year before that. There are loopholes about overtime and other things. So, Democrats have to stay on this. Anyone can tell a story today with a phone. You can do compelling video. I would continue the hearings; I would file subpoenas. There’s no way the Trump campaign and Jared Kushner are talking to Kanye West and this doesn’t go all the way to the Oval Office. This is Trump’s desperate strategy on his part to make it less likely for people to vote by mail and to have those votes counted in a timely manner. So, I would think you’re going to have a paper trail here, and Democrats ought to be all over it.”
He went on to tell Democrats that they can’t take their foot off the gas by thinking that they brought DeJoy to Congress to testify and that everything will be fixed as a result of that.

“That is the last thing that Democrats could do,” he said.

“I am so glad you said that!” Wallace exclaimed. “Let me go back to the second thing that came out of your mouth. I was waiting for the whole thing. Let me say this, it was a meaningless PR statement! That’s what happened today. A meaningless PR statement. You’re absolutely right if Jared Kushner can get on an airplane and meet with Kanye West about a fake run for president to siphon off vote from Joe Biden he certainly was involved in a national effort to slow the mail delivery. Just tell me what the investigation looks like. I asked this last night to Elizabeth Warren. There’s only 76 days left. I know two members of the House Judiciary Committee asked the FBI to look at this. Slice that piece off for me; I’m trying to find out how far this goes. We know Trump is tweeting about it, obviously, he’s talking about it, how do they do that with the short time available?”

Plouffe admitted that an investigation would take a long time, but House Committees have subpoena power, so they can call Trump campaign officials to drive over from Virginia to testify to the House.

“Part of this is to just keep this in the public’s eye,” he said. “Because I think this will hurt Trump with the public because nobody wants to see the post office degraded. Really maybe 10 percent of his base does. So, I’d keep this in the public eye, keep the pressure on. So, at the end of the day, far as I can tell, Nicole, this is Trump’s election strategy. It is not an economic message. He has contradictory messages about Joe Biden; on one hand, he is diminished and has no mental capacity. If he is elected will be drooling in the office. And the other thing is he is such a threat he will destroy everything we stand for. But neither of those is working so his strategy is to cause questions with voters which I think could work, ‘I’m not sure my vote will be counted, I’m confused.'”

He noted that despite urgency by leaders to vote early or get the ballot in the mail early, many people will wait until the last minute. It’s essential, he said, to ensure that those ballots take five to nine days to get to the counties counting them in time.
“Instead of the two or three, you will have hundreds of thousands of ballots spoiled,” he predicted. “So, maybe you’re not going to get to the bottom of this by Election Day but this should be the most important thing happening in the Democratic Party or Congress and hopefully will get relief to people economically, but they have got to be focused like a laser on this and not take the word of Louis DeJoy and Donald Trump or anybody else. Because, he’s just trying to get through these hearings on Friday or Monday. That’s all that statement was.”

But there’s a big difference between Donald Trump going on Twitter to insist he would have won the population vote too if not for illegals voting and Democrats pushing various conspiracy theories before ultimately impeaching him to try and overturn the 2016 election.

Trump’s tweets are very different from the Democratic challenger who already conceded the race after losing filing lawsuits and ultimately arriving at the Supreme Court arguing that the election should be overturned and he made POTUS like we saw in 2000.

Those tweets are very different from a group of Democratic legislatures filing lawsuits trying to block certain states’ electoral votes from counting like we saw in 2004.

So, yeah, if Joe Biden wins Donald Trump will likely say stupid things on Twitter.  Then he’ll leave office and the Biden Administration will begin uninterrupted. There will be no Supreme Court challenges to the results from Republicans.  Republican congressman won’t be looking to block left leaning states’ votes from counting.  There won’t be a bunch of partisan conspiracy theories insisting the election was “stolen” in a never ending end to find some legal loophole to overturn the election.  

Meanwhile if Donald Trump wins, you’re party will say the same stupid stuff on Twitter.  You guys will also go to the Supreme Court looking for them to change the vote.  You’ll try to block states Trump wins from counting.  And you’ll spend the next four years looking for ways to overturn *that* election too.

Now mind you, this is now just water under the bridge. After saying she “believes” his accusers. You’d think believing accusers is a synonym for calling the accused a sexual predator/assailant etc

“It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,” Harris said in the June 2019 debate. “And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. “And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” 

Essentially calling out Joe Biden on working with segregationist in the past, and equating his busing policies with segregation. Which would prevent little girls like her (black girls) from going to school .  Which idk about you, is painting Joe Biden as a little racist.

&gt;Biden tried, with varying success, to exert influence over Bill Clinton during his years in the White House. Biden's signature legislative accomplishment during his four-decade Senate career was the 1994 federal crime bill, passed with Clinton’s support, and much of Biden’s memoir is devoted to his attempts to get a reluctant Clinton to use military force in Kosovo.

&gt;Even now, Bill Clinton occupies a place in Biden’s psyche that Hillary Clinton doesn’t.

8/11/2020,"Yes, it does if investigations are conducted merely for the sake of having an investigation. 

What do you think the Republican Party will call for if Joe Biden wins and they inevitably regain a majority in the house in 2022 or 2024? They will do everything in their power to pounce on any slight scandal in an attempt to slime and de-legitimize a Biden presidency. Why? Because the Democrats did it — rightfully — to Donald Trump. Trump will not go silently, he will continue to tweet and show up at rallies as an ex-President, just to spite his successor. His mark on the nation and Conservative party will continue, certain politicians will need him to become elected in certain states — they will use a Biden presidency as the strawman / catalyst to get elected.

If Biden wins, and the Republicans regain control of the House of Reps — it is somewhat common for the opposition to win control during a President’s 1st term — expect many calls for “investigations.” 

Justice is supposed to be blind, but it is not. 

Has he committed crimes while in office — most likely. Will he be investigated for it, found guilty and jailed? No. 

We are commonly told Ford pardoned Nixon to prevent causing an uproar in the country. If Trump is ever jailed, his supporters will rebel. I’m sure if Clinton was ever tried and jailed, her supporters would also protest. 

These people are too high up the chain to ever be jailed. The worst that will happen to them is losing an election or public position. A senator or congressmen here-or-there will be locked up for corruption or abuse, but my personal opinion is people are naive to think such a thing could happen to Trump. 

He is simply too popular, even while being extremely unpopular. 

I come from Eastern Europe. My comment was geared towards the fact that “lock her up” was chanted at Clinton without any trials being conducted. It was used as a political tool. This type of stuff was often done in my home country, once the opposition gained power, they sought revenge on the former members of government. 

Now, do I dislike what I am writing? Yes.

Justice should be blind and I too would support Trump, Clinton or President Joe Smoe being tried and jailed if they committed a crime. However, it’s unlikely we’d ever see that because their respective supporters would cause mass disruption; it is not worth the cost to society unless the crime is truly severe.

When you must choose between the lesser of two evils, and you can no longer even tell which evil is the lesser, that is no longer a democracy, that is a hostage crisis. To vote for the lesser of two evils is to betray your values in order to preserve a system that... forces you to vote for the lesser of two evils, and further betray your values. That is the trap we find ourselves in. We cannot dig ourselves out of it by voting for the lesser of two evils for the rest of our lives. We will never eventually produce a good choice worth voting for that way, only worse and worse evil. It's like when you are coasting downhill on your bike or in a car and thinking you can eventually climb uphill by hitting your brakes hard and often enough.

(To be honest, I am beginning to doubt that Joe Biden is the lesser evil. The greater evil may be allowing Democrats to continue betraying all their values to support someone who is effectively a Republican. He may also be a more competent imperialist. So, maybe not the lesser evil after all.)

Therefore, most effective choice is to boycott. When more and more people boycott, the system must eventually grapple with the fact that none of the options have been worth voting for, and something new is needed. **That can't happen if you keep voting for the lesser evil.** Because you are saying you are willing to support that lesser evil anyway.

Voting third party is pointless. It would be really nice if socialists could organize a national party with socialist candidates in all races, but that's just not possible as long as the two capitalist parties get to set all the rules.

**Article**:

&gt; White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday accused the Democratic Party and Chinese Communist Party of entering into a “common cause” to defeat President Trump in November.

&gt; “What I think is happening here is that the Democrat Party and the Chinese Communist Party have entered into a common cause to defeat Donald J. Trump and their whole strategy, their whole strategy is based on blaming this administration for a global pandemic created by the Chinese Communist Party,” Navarro told reporters at the White House.

&gt; Navarro did not elaborate on his suggestion that the Democrats and China had entered into some kind of agreement. Later, he insisted that the Chinese Communist Party “has thrown their lot in with the Democrat Party,” saying it was obvious based on China’s “information warfare” against the Trump administration.

&gt; William Evanina, the top U.S. counterintelligence official, said earlier this month that China prefers for Trump to not win reelection and has been expanding influence efforts “to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China.” The statement did not say that China was working to boost Biden or the Democrats, or that the two were somehow working with one another.

&gt; Navarro on Wednesday criticized the Democratic National Convention for what he described as a failure to acknowledge China’s culpability with respect to the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year before it spread globally. Navarro blamed China for the millions of U.S. jobs lost and the more than 170,000 American deaths as a result of the pandemic.

&gt; “They don't talk about policy anymore,” Navarro said of the Democrats. “It's just Donald Trump – 'bad.' That's their whole, whole strategy.”

&gt; Trump has faced criticism for his administration’s handling of the virus, including early delays in testing and his aggressive push to reopen businesses and schools amid the pandemic.

&gt; The president's handling of the disease has been a central focus for Democrats during the first two days of their convention, with former President Clinton tearing into Trump for his response to COVID-19 in a televised address Tuesday evening.

&gt; Navarro asserted Wednesday that the lack of blame placed on China by the Democrats suggests a Joe Biden administration would “turn this country over to the Chinese Communist Party.”

&gt; Biden has through public remarks articulated an agenda aimed at giving the U.S. a competitive edge over China and cracking down on the country’s human rights abuses and unfair trade practices, while the Trump campaign has sought to paint the Democratic candidate as weak on China.

In the worst case scenario I'm talking about (trump win the election, large-scale revolts in cities, millions newly homeless, massive food insecurity, violent secret police put in charge of resources), I don't think loyalty to their president would do much.

As far as when they get here, I think they would need to be massively reeducated somehow.  Yes, they will probably see that a leader who openly suggests fascism is bad - but these are people who legitimately think Joe Biden is a left-wing politican.

&gt;Biden’s devastation of American workers didn’t stop there. He pushed hard to normalize trade relations between the United States and communist China, eventually voting for and leading the effort to give China “most favored nation” trade status. Once again, **Joe Biden made a prediction, saying in September 2000 that, “nor do I see the collapse of the American manufacturing economy, as China, a nation with the impact on the world economy about the size of the Netherlands', suddenly becomes our major economic competitor.” Biden was wrong again, with 3.2 million American jobs lost or displaced due to higher trade deficits with China between 2001 and 2013.**  
  


&gt;As a result of these two horrific trade decisions alone, both of which Joe Biden played a leading role in, 60,000 American factories closed and one in four manufacturing jobs were lost. This poses an obvious question — why would hardworking Ohioans ever give Joe Biden the opportunity to betray them again?

8/21/2020,"Letter from the site:

We are former national security officials who served during the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and/or Donald Trump, or as Republican Members of Congress. We are profoundly concerned about the course of our nation under the leadership of Donald Trump. Through his actions and his rhetoric, Trump has demonstrated that he lacks the character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in corrupt behavior that renders him unfit to serve as President.

For the following reasons, we have concluded that Donald Trump has failed our country and that Vice President Joe Biden should be elected the next President of the United States.

1. ​**Donald Trump has gravely damaged America’s role as a world leader**. Trump has disgraced America’s global reputation and undermined our nation’s moral and diplomatic influence. He has called NATO “obsolete,” branded Europe a “foe,” mocked the leaders of America’s closest friends, and threatened to terminate longstanding US alliances. Other global leaders, friends and foes alike, view him as unreliable, unstable, and unworthy of respect.
2. ​**Donald Trump has shown that he is unfit to lead during a national crisis**. Instead of rallying the American people and the world to confront the coronavirus, Trump has spent the past half year spreading misinformation, undermining public health experts, attacking state and local officials, and wallowing in self-pity. He has demonstrated far greater concern about the fate of his reelection than the health of the American people.
3. **Donald Trump has solicited foreign influence and undermined confidence in our presidential elections**. Trump publicly asked Russian president Vladimir Putin to assist his 2016 campaign, called on Chinese president Xi Jinping to “start an investigation” into his current political opponent, and pressured the president of Ukraine to act against his opponent. Citing exaggerated claims of voter fraud, he has challenged the integrity of this year’s election, even suggesting that it be postponed.
4. **Donald Trump has aligned himself with dictators and failed to stand up for American values**. Trump has regularly praised the actions of dictators and human rights abusers. He proclaimed his “love” and “great respect” for North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, endorsed “brilliant leader” Xi Jinping’s move to serve as China’s president for life, repeatedly sided with Vladimir Putin against our own intelligence community, and pronounced himself a “big fan” of Turkish president Recep Erdogan despite his crackdown on democracy.
5. **Donald Trump has disparaged our armed forces, intelligence agencies, and diplomats**. Trump has attacked Gold Star families, scoffed at American prisoners of war, interfered in the military justice system, and embroiled our military in domestic politics. He has ridiculed US intelligence agencies and falsely branded our nation’s diplomats as the “deep state.”
6. **Donald Trump has undermined the rule of law**. Trump has compromised the independence of the Department of Justice, repeatedly attacked federal judges, and punished government officials who have sought to uphold the law. To protect himself from accountability, he has fired officials who launched investigations or testified against him, threatened whistleblowers, dangled pardons as incentives to stay silent, and blocked prison time for a political crony convicted of lying on his behalf. He has impugned journalists investigating his misconduct and has repeatedly denounced the press as the “enemy of the people.”
7. **Donald Trump has dishonored the office of the presidency**. Trump engages in childish name-calling, mocks the disabled, belittles women, persistently lies, peddles baseless conspiracy theories, and continually embarrasses Americans in the eyes of the world.
8. **Donald Trump has divided our nation and preached a dark and pessimistic view of America**. Trump consistently seeks to incite political, racial, and ethnic divisions, weakening our nation and delighting our adversaries. In contrast to Reagan’s vision of America as a “shining city on a hill,” Trump speaks of “American carnage,” pits Americans against each other, and stokes fears that “angry mobs” and “anarchists” are destroying our country.
9. **Donald Trump has attacked and vilified immigrants to our country**. Trump routinely denigrates immigrants and inflames prejudices as he seeks support for his reelection. Despite America’s legacy as a nation of immigrants, he has demonized Americans who come from other countries, even telling members of Congress whose families immigrated to the United States to “go back” to the “crime-infested places” from which they came.
10. **Donald Trump has imperiled America’s security by mismanaging his national security team**. Trump has dismissed or replaced — often by tweet — the secretaries of State, Defense, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Directors of National Intelligence and the FBI, three National Security Advisors, and other senior officials in critical national security positions, many because they refused to cover for his misdeeds or demonstrate sufficient personal loyalty.

While we – like all Americans – had hoped that Donald Trump would govern wisely, he has disappointed millions of voters who put their faith in him and has demonstrated that he is dangerously unfit to serve another term.

In contrast, we believe Joe Biden has the character, experience, and temperament to lead this nation. We believe he will restore the dignity of the presidency, bring Americans together, reassert America’s role as a global leader, and inspire our nation to live up to its ideals.

While some of us hold policy positions that differ from those of Joe Biden and his party, the time to debate those policy differences will come later. For now, it is imperative that we stop Trump’s assault on our nation’s values and institutions and reinstate the moral foundations of our democracy.

**To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.**",-0.0061

8/17/2020,"Part 3  


Since the original post went viral throughout Cape May County, and the resulting “public apology” from Patrick Wall and Shirley Phinney, a silent protest was organized in part by members of [Cape May County Indivisible](https://www.facebook.com/cmcindivisible) for Friday, August 14, at 6pm. According to a post by the organizers:

“We will line the sidewalk, standing in our power, letting all who love this town know that Hate Has No Home Here. This gathering is in response to the owner of this establishment verbally assaulting and threatening a couple and their daughter after the couple expressed that they would be voting for Joe Biden in November. Please wear a mask and practice all social distancing guidelines so that we may all be safe.”

Despite the apology posted to Facebook by Wall and the offer of a free drink by Phinney, there is reportedly a counter-protest being organized by more “like-minded people” to “pack Elaine’s with Trump supporters.”

So rather than accepting responsibility for accosting a patron for simply stating who they were voting for in the most important election in the country, the owners of Elaine’s are going to turn the situation into a political confrontation.

This is the lesson Trump’s followers have learned, and learned well. Always be on the offensive. Fight every battle. Admit nothing. Never back down. Never say you were wrong. Own the liberals.

One day, hopefully soon, Trump will be gone, but we will still be dealing with the aftermath of the hate and caustic behavior that has become rampant in America. Only in Trump’s America can you find yourself in a position of power and privilege and still cry that you are being persecuted. Only in Cape May County can you find a seasonal business in the middle of a pandemic, with an economy on the verge of catastrophic collapse, and yet so beholden to tribal ideology, that you will chase off customers because they are not of your clan.

You are not worthy of their respect. You have not accepted their dear leader. You do not worship their gods. You are not part of their tribe.

Therefore, you, are not welcome here.

I'm sick of hearing my families stories about the people who come to them for medical care and not being able to afford meds. I'm sick of people thinking its fucking acceptable to let people literally die because some CEO decided that a med that costs pennies is to be sold at prices which are unaffordable. I'm sick of having to think about healthcare every time I switch jobs, or have to renew my coverage.

&gt; This is the single most stupid thing you've said. Really? No propaganda against M4A?

Agreed, there is going to be propaganda no matter what happens the question is how easily can it be addressed M4A is pretty easy to defend because its an actual plan that is fairly well thought out. that was more my point. ACA is particularly problematic because of how complex it was to the point that even state governments don't know how to leverage it properly. most of the problems with M4A involve misinformation spread by the democrats themselves and now they are rejecting it as a option because they basically killed it before even considering it, with nothing even remotely comparable left. it infuriates me to no end.

What bothers me is that he hasn't turned over a new leaf or anything. He campaigned for GOP in 2018 for $200k. When Trump was in office. When Trump was already showing signs of fascism.

But, in order to secure the passage of the bans, they had to agree to a 10-year sunset provision and when the time came, the Bush Administration failed to extend them. As president, Biden will:

&gt;Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. [Federal law](https://www.fws.gov/le/hunter-responsibility.html) prevents hunters from hunting migratory game birds with more than three shells in their shotgun. That means our federal law does more to protect ducks than children. It’s wrong. Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality. While working to pass this legislation, Biden will also use his [executive authority](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/january-2011-importability-certain-shotgunspdf/download) to ban the importation of assault weapons. 

&gt;Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act. Currently, the National Firearms Act requires individuals possessing machine-guns, silencers, and short-barreled rifles to undergo a background check and register those weapons with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Due to these requirements, such weapons are [rarely](https://giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Giffords_GLC_assault-weapons_NFA.pdf) used in crimes. As president, Biden will pursue legislation to [regulate possession of existing assault weapons](https://giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Giffords_GLC_assault-weapons_NFA.pdf) under the National Firearms Act. 

&gt;Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines already in our communities. Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets. This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.

  Nas prévias, deu [sinais de cansaço](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucia-guimaraes/2020/02/terceira-campanha-de-joe-biden-repete-problemas-das-duas-primeiras.shtml), a ponto de alguns comentaristas, como o consagrado Tom Friedman, sugerirem que os debates com o impiedoso Donald Trump deveriam ser contornados ou até evitados.

 Qualquer tropeço será imediatamente apresentado como um sinal de confusão e senilidade, numa mera repetição dos truques usados contra Hillary Clinton em 2016.

 A pandemia complica a situação de Biden. O senador do Delaware tem passado grande parte dos últimos três meses trancafiado em sua residência.

 Se a obrigação do distanciamento social criou um ambiente midiático mais controlado que minimizou o risco de gafes e lapsos, o candidato não terá alternativa senão começar a bater perna depois da Convenção Nacional do partido, [agendada para a próxima semana](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/democratas-adiam-convencao-do-partido-devido-ao-coronavirus.shtml).

 É nesse contexto que deve ser examinada a escolha de [Kamala Harris](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/em-aceno-a-negros-e-mulheres-biden-escolhe-kamala-harris-para-vice.shtml). Susan Rice era uma solução de conforto. Sem base política, a antiga chefe do Conselho Nacional de Segurança na era Obama seria uma boa gestora sem grandes ambições políticas.

 Numa eleição tradicional, Gretchen Whitmer teria sido a melhor escolha do ponto de vista puramente eleitoral. A popular governadora entregaria de bandeja Michigan, um dos estados mais competitivos.

 Mas esta não é uma eleição normal, e Biden precisava de uma vice de combate. Kamala Harris ganhou dimensão nacional ao massacrar o [controverso Brett Kavanaugh](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2018/09/democratas-tentam-adiar-audiencia-de-juiz-indicado-por-trump-a-suprema-corte.shtml), indicado de Trump à Suprema Corte.

 Apesar de assustadoramente amadora, sua campanha nas prévias consolidou a imagem de uma mulher de palanque que não hesita em avançar contra o inimigo —o próprio Biden sentiu seu poder de retórica na pele durante um dos primeiros debates.

 Conhecida por gostar de gastar a sola dos seus tênis Converse, Kamala será pau para toda obra da campanha Biden.

 Dos sonolentos debates em salas sem janela com 40 eleitores indecisos de um estado-pêndulo aos eventos televisivos multidimensionais com milhões de espectadores, a candidata a vice estará em todo lado, o tempo todo, dando margem para Biden conduzir uma campanha mais solene e cerimonial.

 É o encontro de uma candidata treinada para a era digital e de um candidato acostumado ao ritmo do século passado. Vices ambiciosos costumam criar desconfiança, mas Biden precisava de uma mulher capaz de roubar a cena.

 A escolha de Kamala traz os seus riscos. Em sua longa carreira política, a senadora pela Califórnia frequentou algumas figuras pouco recomendáveis, como o ex-prefeito de São Francisco Willie Brown, um personagem digno de um bom Martin Scorcese, enrolado em negócios imobiliários, acusações de corrupção e clientelismo.

 No começo dos anos 2000, ele se tornou conhecido por colocar pessoas do seu círculo próximo em posições de poder, inclusive uma jovem e promissora procuradora distrital chamada Kamala Harris.

* While having several policies that would help the Black community, his black outreach or at lest the messaging did not hit the mark.

* His focus on the youth vote, who would rather tweet about making the world better than actually doing anything like voting.

8/12/2020,"Yeah I don’t know. I think the number of people who look at Harris as a VP pick and think it’s a dealbreaker because “she’s a cop“ so they don’t vote against Donald Trump is a very small though very vocal number of fairly young people who are low propensity voters to begin with. I know that frustrates a lot of people on Reddit, but the Democratic Party, and really any party that’s looking to build a broad coalition is not going to go crazy trying to placate that type of person.

She’s actually hated by the police union in California because she declined to seek the death penalty against a guy who killed a cop and because she supported to ballot measures to end the death penalty in California. 

I like that she shifted to going after people exploiting women rather than going after prostitutes. I love the Open Justice data initiative. I like that she fought for California to get a better payout from the mortgage settlement. 

Yes I can pick apart the cases and positions she took as a prosecutor and find things I don’t like but their is also a degree to which I understand that prosecutors are part of system and their are always concessions made.

In the end no matter how far to the left you are, the president is going to be either Joe Biden or Donald Trump and I cannot imagine how one believes that things we want on the left are going to be easier to get if Donald Trump remains president. The next president is likely to replace two liberals and a conservative on the Supreme Court. Trump gets in again and every attempt to get healthcare, criminal justice reform and economic reforms will be magically unconstitutional.",-0.0031

8/22/2020,"Now before I say anything, it needs to be said that this kid was a total shithead at 12 years old. He tried to extort a girl into giving him nudes, under the threat of posting nudes of her that had been spreading around the school online. 

This is obviously horrible. As was his bullying. But there is suddenly this idea that this kid is unrepentant. He has shown a ton of contrition, owning up to his accusations from the day they were levied against him. He has expressed regret and remorse, and revealed that he is fraught with PTSD from an abusive elementary school and a broken impoverished home where the father is mentally ill and the mother is only a part time teacher. 

So we have to ask ourselves, why can’t we afford him some agency for growth? It’s one thing to rape a woman at 20 (Kavanaugh) or 45 (Joe Biden). It’s another thing to be a (really) shitty 12-14 year old. 

I recommend reading the piece because Greenwald does break down the hypocrisy of the Democrats, from putting accused pedophile Bill Clinton on stage, to serial sexual harasser Bloomberg, behind an accused rapist and serial sexual harasser Joe Biden. Or how the Kansas State Democrats are pumping $20,000 in for a write in campaign for an anti-choice “Democrat” who caucuses with Republicans. It really speaks to class politics and partisanship more than anything.

8/23/2020,"You’re the one assuming I’m a conservative here. I’m a libertarian, but I guess you’re just one of those people who think “A vote for -anyone who isn’t Joe Biden- is a vote for Trump” kinda person. I am conservative and I am a traditionalist. Donald Trump is a bad President, no shit, it’s partially his fault that the US is doing so awful at handling COVID. He has been divorced and bankrupt more times than he’s made books, and he fronts as a Christian when it is evident that he knows little to nothing about the Bible.

But when it comes to sexual assault? Yeah. He’s guilty of it, but when you compare The Clinton Foundation, their involvement with Washington and Hollywood, and all the people and children who they have hurt in the process, then I’d rather side with the cheat and liar who has a smaller rap sheet. 

The US, at this point, is just picking and choosing between senile old bastards to manage the whole country.

8/19/2020,"I’m inclined to partially agree. Joe Biden is leagues above Donald Trump, but isn’t without his faults. American politics has become a perverse establishment that is a shell of its former glory. Joe Biden is much more moderate than his constituents and, politically, fills a gap that Americans really need. That gap being the depolarization of parties. The past 12 years, in my opinion, have been extremely toxic and has sent both parties on a spiraling downward fall towards overt and dangerous polarization. That being said, I don’t personally feel that Joe Biden will have the capabilities to reign in the far right and pull from across the aisle. That’s what we need. We truly need someone that can shorten the gap between right and left both in politics and the general public. It’s too combative of an environment and is overly toxic in all aspects. Both sides call each other evil instead of asking how we can work together for the common good.

8/11/2020,"Lets go back to 2016.  The head of the DNC Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who had worked on Clintons 2008 campaign, signed a deal with Hillary, where Clinton would fund raise for the Democratic Party.  In exchange, Clinton would have total control over the finances of the Democratic Party.  This deal was signed IN 2015.

Just before the 2016 Democrat Convention, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz resigned her post, to take a position in Clinton's campaign as an honorary chair of the 50 state program.  None of this seems a bit shady to you?

I'm not a fan of Bernie Sanders.  I believe he is too far left in his policies.  But I believe he should have gotten a fair shake from the party he represents.  His rallies and energy at the time should have swept him into the nomination.  

Fast forward to present.  Joe Biden came into the race late.  Bernie was surging.  Then, just before Super Tuesday, moderates Klobuchar and Buttigieg, two moderates who split Bidens voter base, dropped out and rushed to endorse Biden, within a day of each other, which helped him surge to the nomination.  Doesn't feel a bit slimy?

8/20/2020,"Obama said,” well here is the point, this president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies so they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote and to convince you that your vote does not matter. That is how they win. That is how they keep getting to make decisions that effect your life and the lives of the people you love.” 

Who is the establishment and who changed the status quo? Joe Biden who has been in politics for 47 years and is backed by everyone else who’s been in politics for just as long, or Donald Trump who had no reason to leave billion dollar business to simply fix the damage Obama’s presidency had done? Democrats are notorious for blaming republicans for everything they’ve ever done, sometimes doing it in advance. Are you trying to tell us something Obama?

Obama also called our constitution racist and sexist. That statement is in direct opposition to the view of great civil rights leaders like Frederick Douglass. Douglass said,”Abolish slavery tomorrow, and not a sentence or syllable of the Constitution need be altered. It was purposely so framed as to give no claim, no sanction to the claim, of property in man. If in its origin slavery had any relation to the government, it was only as the scaffolding to the magnificent structure, to be removed as soon as the building was completed.” 

Nothing about the constitution was pro-slavery or anti-slavery. It was pro-precedent and before George Washington was even elected the precedent was overwhelming set against slavery. Take the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 as one example. The abolitionist movement was not a progressive movement to move away from the constitution but an effort to restore and conserve the constitution.

Obama lied about the pandemic for political gain. Under Obama 60 million Americans were infected by H1N1. Under Trump 5 million Americans have been infected by COVID-19. All variables considered the same, if Obama handled COVID-19 the same way as H1N1 at least 3 million Americans would’ve died. Under Trump 173,000 Americans have died. 

Trumps containment strategy was the best it could be. He enacted a China travel ban despite fierce resistance and getting labeled a racist. Weak Europeans countries on the other hand were too afraid of China too enact travel ban. As a result the first coronavirus cases to seed in the U.S came from Europe. Like the medical professionals said, if the virus wasn’t contained to China, it would inevitably reach the U.S. 

Trumps mitigation strategy was also like none other. Today countries around the world rely heavily on the medical equipment we produce and they marvel at the fact that we’ve tested 60 million Americans. Compare that to the #2 country India with 11 million tests. Please visit my profile to view a chart showing that deaths occurred more than 3 times more frequently in democrat states than Republican states. 

Obama and other democrats talk about injustice but where do those injustices occur? In democrat cities you crooked idiots!!! It’s where blacks die most frequently to homicide. It’s where 22,500,000 black babies have been aborted. It’s where the most people are shot by police including unarmed black men. Why are more unarmed black men wrongly killed in liberal cities? Democrats let murderers and rapists back on the street and prevent police from enforcing the crimes that matter, while forcing police to strictly enforce stupid liberal laws. If Governor Como didn’t pass a law banning the sale of single cigarettes and expected it to be strictly enforced, Eric Gardner would have never been approached by police and would have never been skeptical of police for their stupid concern. 

Obama just supported a Marxist Anti-Semitic Hate group that hides behind a truism that no one disputes. How despicable can you get? BLM  protestors shot a white woman in the head for saying all lives matter. BLM protestors nearly killed a transgender woman after trying save a white man dragged out of his truck and brutally beaten. When a 5 year old kid was shot by a random black man, BLM protestors tweeted,”Shot his white little privileged brains clear out of his head #BlackLivesMatter”

8/18/2020,"If I may paraphrase South Park, most presidential elections nowadays seem to end up being between a giant douche and a turd sandwich; at least in most people’s opinions. In 2016, almost everyone hated Trump and considered him a joke. On the other hand, people also just did not like Hilary Clinton, for whatever reason. So, every article and commentary you read spoke endlessly about the horrible choice we were faced with. It was accepted that Clinton would win because no one would take that other clown seriously. Nobody seemed to notice the cult that was building around him until it was too late. So by election time, a lot of people were so cynical about the process that they decided to either not vote at all or to (I apologize for this phrase) “waste their vote” by voting for third or fourth party candidates. Most interesting of all were some Bernie Sanders followers who, in a weird, gotterdammerung-type move decided that if they couldn’t vote for Bernie, they’d vote for Trump (the logic escapes me). In any case, these things, along with the damnable electoral college, helped elect the most incompetent man ever to sit in the Oval Office. 

My point is this: everything that everyone has said about the state of american politics is absolutely correct. It does need a major overhaul and we definitely deserve better candidates. There’s a much larger issue this year, however, and it’s name is Donald Trump. I think rational minds would agree that our country might not be able to take four more years of him in the White House. His cult is going to vote for him no matter what. Therefore, it would seem that the only rational move for the rest of us is to go in the opposite direction. By that, I mean, as distasteful as it may be for some of you, vote for Joe Biden. He was not the best candidate the democrats had running, but he’s who they ended up with and we need to support him.

8/13/2020,"Well looking back into it, the dates on that website are somewhat misleading. The change to Panama ownership was last year. 

The site has gone through several changes. It was registered to a Russian Private Domain Registrar a few years ago, and then was moved to a different one late last year now based in Panama. About a year ago the site changed to an “interest check” from someone trying to sell the website. 

It remained in that state until May 31st of this year, when it turned into an “official” antifa site linked to an “official” antifa Twitter and YouTube that has...less than 200 followers. There was little to no real content on the site and most of the links went nowhere. 

Last weekend the site was changed to redirect to Joebiden.com. Nobody “noticed” that until shortly before the press conference today. 

Shortly after the press conference the site was taken down. I am unsure of how this was done, and if it was done by the site owners or the Biden team. Biden’s team could block redirects from that site from getting to JoeBiden.com, which is what I’m assuming happened. 

A private domain registrar is essentially someone you pay to register the website for you, so it obscures the real person behind the website. This is commonly used in many different circumstances and there are many companies across the world offering this service. Most of which also sell you the domain name. 
However, Panama has a history of being the location for shell companies and hard to track down hierarchies. It was likely chosen so it will be impossible to track down the person(s) responsible for the website. 

This website is mainly interesting as it has changed content at some VERY specific times in the past few months. It first came online as the “antifa homepage” on/around May 31st. The very same day that Barr announced an investigation into bad actors in protests using “antifa-style” tactics. 
The content on the site changed slightly for the next few weeks and each time it correlates with Trump or Barr saying something about Antifa in the news. 

The next major change (to the JoeBiden.com redirect) was made last weekend, right around the time that stories were coming out that Biden had chosen his VP. 

The website was brought up after Trump asked the reporter from OAN to provide a question. She asked him about, “if you Google antifa.com, Joe Biden’s campaign website comes up...” 
There are almost no mentions of the site online until shortly before the press conference today. 

There is a good write up on the situation [here](https://news.yahoo.com/atifa-website-one-america-chanel-rion-russia-004727528.html) including more info about the reporter who asked. I find their research into the website to be a little lacking and missing some details about the changes to the site and the timing of it all.

*  Biden will **enact** universal background  check **legislation**, requiring a background check for all gun sales with  very limited exceptions, such as gifts between close family members.  
*  Biden will **enact** [**legislation**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2708) prohibiting an individual “who has been convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime... 
*  Close the “Charleston loophole.” 
*  ...almost 500,000 fugitives from justice  who are prohibited from purchasing firearms were deleted from the  background check system. The Biden Administration will restore these  records, and **enact legislation**... 
*  Biden will **enact** [**legislation**](https://marchforourlives.com/peace-plan/) to prohibit all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits, and gun parts. 

**Can be done by executive order:**

*  Reinstate the Obama-Biden policy to keep guns out of the hands  of certain people unable to manage their affairs for mental reasons,  which President Trump reversed. 
*  Biden will also use his [executive authority](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/january-2011-importability-certain-shotgunspdf/download) to ban the importation of assault weapons.

 **I have no idea if this can be done by executive order:**

Seriously capitalism is defined by the economy being run by private individuals for profit rather than by the state. He is a capitalist whether you like it or not. So is Joe Biden. Also Trump has never removed regulations that clearly regulated externalities like pollution. You have to give me a source on that. His defunding of the EPA and removal of unnecessary environmental regulations greatly helped the energy industry. It helped them to create more oil fracking jobs and create nuclear power plants. Obama’s regulation made oil fracking nearly impossible. His defunding of the EPA also stopped them from stealing land from people who they thought were violating one of their arbitrary rules.,-0.0015

What part of a federal mask mandate would violate which part of the commerce clause? This is a ludicrously insufficient answer. 

&gt;	It takes two seconds of googling. Try it out sometime

This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve had this conversation with conservatives before and different people go down different routes. All end up being wrong, as at the end of the day it’s constitutional, but I don’t know which path you personally believe in until you tell me. 


&gt;	Kamala harris says she wants to ban all assault weapons. Assault weapon is defined as any semi automatic rifle, handgun, and some shotgun. The current VP nominee and likely the future president if Joe Biden gets elected, wants to ban most of not all guns through way of executive order, regardless of the constitution.

If someone does something else that’s unconstitutional, that’s unconstitutional. Duh. Common sense gun control is not unconstitutional. I have yet to hear a **single** argument to the contrary. You just keep making terrible slippery slope arguments and talking about Kamala Harris. Stay focused. This is about if gun control is unconstitutional, not about who will be the president. Gun control is absolutely constitutional even if Trump is president. 


Also, **you** define assault weapons to be that, but what does Kamala Harris define them to be? Maybe ask that question. You just have a disagreement of definitions.

&gt;[Trump’s EO quote]

Firstly, this EO didn’t exist when conservatives where saying it was unconstitutional to ban infowars and Stefan M from YouTube. Secondly, as much as Trump EOs to his heart’s content, there is zero sound basis to argue that Facebook is legally liable for all things posted on Facebook. That’s simply **ludicrous**. That’s not how the internet works. Any lawsuit that comes forth suing Facebook over non-protected speech based on Facebook posts by random people on the platform will be thrown out. If they appeal high enough the only thing that will happen is the law Trump keeps point to in his EO will be struck down. They are so **obviously** not legally liable, that even if the law technically says they are, the court case in question will just strike down whatever law makes them liable. 

&gt;	There’s definitely some intense taxation, such as the inheritance tax, which is blatant theft

Theft is a legally defined term, and paying one’s taxes correctly as detailed by the government is not theft. It’s as simple as that. If you want to say you think it is “morally theft” then you’re really just saying you don’t approve. It’s fine to not approve of something. That’s simply not theft.",-0.0003

8/14/2020,"Os Estados Unidos enviaram três [bombardeiros com capacidade nuclear B-2 ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2008/02/375226-aviao-bombardeiro-americano-cai-em-base-aerea-no-pacifico.shtml)para a base de Diego Garcia, uma ilha no oceano Índico que permite ações em todo o flanco sul da China.

 É a primeira vez que isso acontece desde 2016, e o recado é direcionado a Pequim, com quem Washington vive um [período de alta tensão diplomática, comercial e militar,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/washington-e-pequim-aumentam-tom-do-confronto-no-mar-do-sul-da-china.shtml) dentro da chamada [Guerra Fria 2.0 entre os países.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/guerra-fria-20-entra-em-nova-fase-com-ameaca-de-sancoes-entre-eua-e-china.shtml)

 Obviamente ninguém está pensando em bombardear o adversário, mas a lógica do deslocamento é a da intimidação e a de demonstrar poder, num momento em que chineses e americanos intensificam seus jogos de guerra no disputado mar do Sul da China.

 Além disso, a posição de Diego Garcia, a 1.800 km ao sul da costa indiana, sinaliza apoio a Nova Déli, que há dois meses entrou [em choque militar com Pequim](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/06/china-e-india-prometem-reduzir-tensao-mas-mantem-acusacoes-apos-conflito.shtml) em uma remota região dos Himalaias, perdendo 20 soldados.

 Central no gesto americano é[ a escolha da arma apresentada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/05/bombardeiros-dos-eua-pressionam-pequim-no-mar-do-sul-da-china.shtml). O deslocamento dos aviões é um gesto público, calculado. E o B-2 é um aparelho único em suas capacidades.

 Ele é a aeronave mais cara já produzida, custando US$ 2 bilhões (R$ 10,8 bilhões) cada um. É apelidado de avião invisível, por adotar tecnologias que o tornam furtivo à detecção por radares. Os EUA operam 20 deles.

  Podem lançar bombas e mísseis convencionais ou nucleares em ambientes altamente protegidos, como seria o caso de instalações chinesas.

 Os três aparelhos decolaram de sua base no Missouri (EUA) na terça e, 29 horas depois, chegaram a Diego Garcia sobrevoando o Pacífico apoiados por diversos voos de aviões-tanque.

 Lá já estão postados seis bombardeiros estratégicos B-52, também com capacidade nuclear, mas esses são aviões dos anos 1950, feitos para lançar mísseis a longa distância.

 Além do simbolismo, ainda mais na semana em que a China [ameaça a ilha de Taiwan](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/china-faz-ameaca-militar-a-taiwan-durante-visita-de-autoridade-dos-eua.shtml), aliada dos EUA, com exercícios militares, a ida dos B-2 é um exemplo da nova tática da Força Aérea americana.

 No começo do ano, o país desativou sua força permanente de[ bombardeiros em Guam](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/05/bombardeiros-dos-eua-pressionam-pequim-no-mar-do-sul-da-china.shtml), a principal base no Pacífico. Agora, grupos menores de aviões são rotacionados por bases, aumentando a imprevisibilidade estratégica.

 Diego Garcia é bastante distante de alvos em terra: aviões que saíam de lá contra o Afeganistão demoravam dez horas para começar a atacar. Isso também é, por outro lado, uma vantagem.

 Quando os seis B-52 foram enviados para lá em janeiro, o objetivo era tê-los à mão para uma ação contra o Irã, [contra quem os EUA quase foram à guerra neste ano.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/eua-e-ira-podem-cantar-vitoria-mas-crise-esta-longe-de-acabar.shtml)

 Se ficassem no ponto usual de ações no Oriente Médio, a base de Uded (Qatar), estariam à mercê de ataques com mísseis balísticos de Teerã que não chegam a Diego Garcia.

 Desde que Donald Trump assumiu, em 2017, [a retórica ante os chineses passou a ser mais agressiva](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/guerra-fria-20-entra-em-nova-fase-com-ameaca-de-sancoes-entre-eua-e-china.shtml). Ambos os países se preparam para retomar negociações para congelar a guerra tarifária disparada pelos americanos, que veem injustiça na relação bilateral com Pequim.

 Mas as hostilidades se ampliaram, em especial neste ano, em que Trump precisa agradar sua base de apoio numa corrida eleitoral que hoje estaria perdida para o democrata Joe Biden. Mas o pleito é só em novembro.

 Assim, [agora há uma política aberta de qualificar a China ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/paises-precisam-escolher-entre-tirania-e-liberdade-diz-secretario-de-estado-sobre-a-china.shtml)como um adversário do dito mundo livre, e os embates vão da defesa da autonomia amputada por Pequim em Hong Kong ao manejo da pandemia do novo coronavírus, [passando por fechamentos de consulados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/eua-ordenam-fechamento-de-consulado-chines-e-pequim-prepara-retaliacao.shtml).

 O aspecto militar se delineou mais claramente com o aumento de atividade americana no mar do Sul da China, que Pequim diz ser 85% seu. Desde 2014, os chineses militarizaram áreas na região. Em 2016, Pequim perdeu uma disputa na ONU com as Filipinas sobre um trecho territorial, mas não aceitaram o resultado.

 Não por coincidência, esse julgamento ocorreu no mesmo momento da última visita dos B-2 a Diego Garcia.

 Incursões aéreas e exercícios navais se multiplicam de lado a lado, aumentando a possibilidade de um choque acidental. Na segunda (17), os EUA começam uma grande manobra militar no Pacífico, e até o fim do ano deve ocorrer o Malabar, encontro das marinhas da Índia, EUA e Austrália —todos adversários de Pequim.",-0.6071

 Trata-se da crescente cooperação entre as ricas monarquias do Golfo e Tel Aviv, visando conter o inimigo comum: [o Irã dos aiatolás.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/05/envio-de-petroleiros-do-ira-para-venezuela-eleva-tensao-com-os-eua.shtml)

 Teerã busca projeção de poder regional e é o centro do muçulmanismo xiita, minoritário na religião.

 Já o mundo sunita, majoritário, tem mais polos, mas na região gravita em torno da Arábia Saudita, de quem os Emirados são aliados firmes.

 Como o inimigo do meu inimigo é meu amigo, há anos há tratativas secretas entre as partes, sempre visando cooperação de inteligência para coibir principalmente o uso de prepostos iranianos na região.

 Israel se preocupa com dois, [o Hizbullah,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/05/alemanha-proibe-todas-as-atividades-do-grupo-libanes-hizbullah-no-pais.shtml) que ganhou muita musculatura militar no Líbano e lutou na guerra civil da vizinha Síria, e o mais restringido Hamas, que não é xiita mas opera em sintonia com Teerã em seu regime quase totalitário na faixa de Gaza.

  Já os Estados do Golfo temem pelo fluxo de seu petróleo, já que o Irã tem crescentes capacidades militares para atividades disruptivas no estreito de Hormuz.

 Além disso, Teerã usa aliados xiitas locais para confrontos por procuração contra os sunitas, como no [caso do conflagrado Iêmen ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/coalizao-saudita-anuncia-cessar-fogo-de-duas-semanas-contra-rebeldes-houthis.shtml)e, de forma menos trágica, no Qatar.

 Havia algo a impedir a consumação dessa aliança tácita: os palestinos. Comandados de forma autocrática em seu embate com Israel, eles sempre estiveram na narrativa dos países árabes como uma trava a qualquer entendimento com o Estado judeu.

 Os Emirados deverão ser seguidos, na tentativa de normalizar laços com Tel Aviv, por Estados menores, como Bahrein. Se a tendência chegar, como parece possível, a Riad, aí [uma nova configuração da região](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2017/12/1945765-queda-do-estado-islamico-redesenha-oriente-medio.shtml) estará colocada.

 O que poderá aumentar o sofrimento dos palestinos, dado que um dos poucos caminhos fora dos abaixo-assinados de protesto dos humanistas europeus que poderão seguir será o de se radicalizarem. É tudo o que o Irã quer.

 No ano passado,[ Trump brincou de Bill Clinton e anunciou um plano mirabolante ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/plano-de-trump-para-israel-e-palestina-reune-hipocrisia-e-realismo.shtml)de paz para Israel. Só uma coisa saiu do evento farsesco.

 Foi a promessa do então acossado premiê Binyamin Netanyahu de anexar de vez cerca de 30% da Cisjordânia. Ele acabou conseguindo ficar no poder e viu crescer a possibilidade de um confronto com o Hizbullah devido ao plano.

 Assim, a suspensão da anexação, que cheira a encenação, ganha tempo ao israelense. Uma real coordenação em duas frentes contra o Irã e seus aliados é o que importa.

 Para Trump, se o plano de 2019 não parece ter lhe rendido um voto, parece improvável que o acordo de agora o faça na sua disputa apertada pela reeleição no pleito de novembro.

 Se estiver fora do poder no ano que vem, contudo, será interessante ver como[ Joe Biden ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/apos-ser-escolhida-como-vice-kamala-harris-faz-primeira-aparicao-ao-lado-de-biden.shtml)reviverá a tradição democrata de buscar consenso na região e trazer os palestinos de volta para a equação.

 A resposta realista é bastante sombria para as aspirações de autonomia dos palestinos. Conformismo e radicalização podem coexistir, mas uma hora um lado se sobrepõe.

 Para Washington, uma nova[ etapa geopolítica na região mais espinhosa do mundo,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/oriente-medio-e-cipoal-de-aliancas-e-conflitos.shtml) com implicações energéticas para todo o planeta, poderá valer o custo do arranjo feito.

8/21/2020,"‘Dangerously unfit’: 73 former Republican officials warn Trump has ‘imperiled’ US national security in Biden endorsement
‘It is imperative that we stop Trump’s assault on our nation’s values and institutions’


A group of former US national security officials from across four Republican administrations have endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race against Donald Trump, who has “demonstrated that he lacks the character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in corrupt behaviour that renders him unfit to serve as president,” the group said in a statement.",-0.2750
8/22/2020,There were some real human moments in Iraq when the US invaded based on nonessential that Joe fucking Biden championed.  And that’s not the least of his shit record.  He’s also a notorious plagiarizer.,-0.2750
8/22/2020,Yes. I have around 10-15 thousand 2020 election ballots that the demonrat party paid me to fill out and mail.  Please call demonrat Elaine Luria at (202) 225-4215 for payment and pickup. Thanks so much and remember to vote for Sleepy Creepy Joe Biden because Orange Man Bad!!!,-0.2750

Yes the corona response has been politicized, by fucking TRUMP. Of course people go crazy banning flights from china jesus christ how stupid can you be banning flights from china when the virus is already in America and all over the world are you serious? Talk about trying to look like you’re doing something without actually doing anything at all.

The point is tens of thousands of Americans are dead, he bumped that number up with his lack of concern for our safety and his obsession with the economic ramifications. Ill never forget him downplaying this thing like it was no big deal for weeks. Just to keep people working so the economy doesn’t look bad. That was an election calculation plain and simple.

Comparing his abject failure on coronavirus response to literally anything Joe Biden has ever done wrong is just fucking ridiculous. Don’t even bother trying.",-0.2749

From [joebiden.com](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/):

&gt;Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets. *This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.*

Italics mine.

So maybe not turning in *all* guns, or outlawing *all* rifles, but these proposals are intended to make it as expensive and as difficult as possible for individuals to maintain ownership of a very broad and common category of firearms and accessories.

Biden will be allowed to cut Social Security because Democrats get away with doing the awful things Republicans can only dream of such as Bill Clinton passing NAFTA or repealing Glass–Steagall.

Before the 46-year-old Beau passed away that May from an aggressive form of brain cancer, he had been a firm advocate for his Dad to run and, even in intense grief, Biden made serious preparations in the summer and fall of 2015 to jump into the race.

&gt; The Clinton camp took Biden’s deliberations seriously. Podesta told people he believed Biden would go for it. The Clinton team assembled an oppo-research book on him with the code name “Project Acela,” according to one former Clinton official. Negative stories began popping up.

Trump would be unable to resort to overt, dictator-style election fraud. He could try to interfere in the election through legal means though.

Scenario:

* Two days before the election, Barr announces an investigation into Hunter and Joe Biden on made-up charges. 

* Ukraine or Russia manufacture a trove of hacked emails suggesting Democrats are engaged in a massive election fraud scheme involving illegal immigrants, false ballots and rewired voting machines.

* Election Day. Trump deploys HHS agents to cities and pivot districts in swing states. They are to check the voter IDs of anyone entering polling stations and detain anyone who they have reasonable suspicion of entering the country illegally, and disconnect voting machines that are suspected of being tampered with.

* Conflicts between voters and HHS agents ensue. Perhaps State Police intervene too, leading possibly to armed conflict between State and Federal officers. Riots erupt, making it impossible for people to vote in these key areas.

* The election is swung, America descends into chaos.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. In Ohio, a few days ago, you said, quote, Joe Biden has “hurt God”; “he’s against God.” The Vice President has said that he’s a man of deep Catholic faith, and he has credited it for helping him endure some immense personal tragedy. So, sir, what did you mean by that, when you said that Joe Biden has “hurt God” or is “against God”?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you look at the manifesto that that they’ve come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do, very importantly, with aspects of religion and faith: I don’t think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you just — you can’t put that into the realm of a religious group of people, I will say that.

And I think it’s one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which — I’m not a big believer in polls. I wouldn’t — if I was, I guess I wouldn’t be standing here right now.

And, by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know, and Joe’s are going down very rapidly. He’ll have to come out of the basement, it looks like, pretty soon, because that — you know, it’s one of those things.

But, no, if you look at the manifesto — I call it the “manifesto.” A lot of people are calling it a “manifesto.” My opinion: It’s further left than where Bernie was before. So normally, he’d be left and you’d bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there — and I’m not only talking in terms of religion; I’m not talking, even, in terms of religion — but some of the things they have in the agreement made — and this was an agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe — it’s a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country.

It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. We will — it will be terrible for healthcare. Just terrible. You’ll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country.",-0.1952

We need to talk.

Our ruling class is promoting this carnival act as a way of insulting our sense of dignity, causing us to question our grip on reality. 

Some context. Millions of ordinary people are suffering greatly right now due to the blunder of world historic proportions: Covid19. Out of work, alienated, frustrated, and greatly anxious as a result of being at the mercy of people who hate them. 

Cardi B is a whore. A disgusting carnival act that our cultural and corporate rulers promote to the masses. They do this because it degenerates culture and moves product. 

Joe Biden, who is a demented old fondler of children, apparently thinks this is a good use of his time at our expense. This is echolalic babbling about nonsense intended for simpletons and drunk people. 

They should all be ashamed. This should be beneath our dignity. As citizens of the apex of civilization, our sense of honor should be offended by this.

But when it comes to U.S presidential voting I don't give a fuck. The Watts Riots were a 6 day violent civil rights riot that had people shooting and attacking cops and government officials. Shortly afterwards the Civil Rights Bill was passed. This shows how effective getting violent is. I'm not saying people need to die or kill people. But violence and physicality needs to exist. We're dealing with murderous corruption on a large systemic scale. It's not going to go away by voting for people who are racist and have historically oppressed black people. Biden and Trump are both racist and have historically oppressed black people. To me Biden and Trump make no difference. They're both evil and the evil shouldn't be on the table in the first place.

&gt;Speaking of his restriction on travel from China, President Donald Trump said “I had (Joe) Biden calling me xenophobic. ... He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.” That’s Mostly False.

&gt;Biden tweeted: “We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.”

&gt;But Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.

.Biden said: “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.”

And no surprise, but Trump continues to be a racist xenophobe.

Here’s the thing though, nobody is enthusiastic about Biden. I live in an extremely liberal area and have legit seen one Biden sign. I’ve seen more maga/pro america signs/flags/bumper stickers than I have Biden or BLM. All the friends I’ve talked to about current events and politics think the left has gone absolutely insane. I have a super hippy friend who even said he will probably vote Trump. People are getting fed up with this shit, especially with the riots. They’re fed up with the insane bias and trash reporting coming from mainstream news. Even my mom, who hates politics, is done with all the bullshit and will probably vote Trump. 

There is a huge enthusiasm gap between Trump and Biden. Nobody wants Sleepy Creepy Joe and the only reason people will vote for him is because they hate Trump. It’s pathetic, really. Trump has also been closing the gap in the polls lately, not that polls mean a lot at this point, but it’s a good sign. If Biden doesn’t somehow weasel out of the debates, he will get absolutely demolished by Trump and the election will be all but decided. However, whichever side you’re on, no matter how you think “your guy” will do in the election, we all gotta get out there and vote. Do I think Trump will lose? No. I think the dems/DNC are a pathetic mess and they know it. But I’m not gonna get cocky and not vote.",-0.1681
8/12/2020,"Thank you for your civil response. Like most people I hated Trump because of the headlines I read from the MSM. But during the lockdown I had nothing to do, so I decided to do the research myself and I came to the conclusion that Trump isn’t that bad and he actually cares about the American people. He’s done a lot for America as far as trade deal, tariffs, the economy and child trafficking. I also think he is a far better candidate than Biden. IMO Tulsi or Bernie should of won the nomination and I probably would of voted for them but somehow creepy Joe Biden won.

So the author is claiming that Kamala Harris is small and brown. Is being brown bad? So why is calling someone brown a bad thing? It seems to me to be an accurate description of a noticeable distinction. Unless you believe being brown is bad then you shouldn’t care about being called brown. He also claims that Joe Biden is essentially absent and going to let kamala run the campaign. Which indicates he sees her as being the “brains” of the operation. How sexist. It may be a little condescending but I think a clear distinction needs to be made between an insulting tone and racism.  Never once is a claim made that black people are inferior or that women are incompetent. It makes no allusions towards anything denigrating. Other than calling a grown woman little which would have been equally as insulting for a man. Is little a derogatory term towards women now? I always thought it was a adjective to describe something small. The author may be alluding to the fact that Joe Biden picked a vp pick mostly based off race and gender and is trying to show how ironic it is that he is using racism and sexism as well as exploiting peoples compassion to win votes.

I guess that just doesn't fit your narrative, now does it?

Biden has *always* been a convergence candidate. He stakes out a position as the middle of the wings of the party. That's one of the chief reasons Obama picked him. Did you forget that little fact, or did you simply not follow politics until the 2016 election cycle? 

If you're actually a progressive who actually can vote, then you did a piss poor job of getting other progressives to the polls. Sorry, you're not the majority, and Bernie ran a shit campaign.

We see this with Covid. The experts have been wrong on many things because they are speculating. We shut down an entire economy on their say so and tens of millions have suffered. Experts can be wrong and you have every right to question them. Just because you adhere to the cult of the experts, which the Left loves because it allows them to silence their foes, doesn't mean people with more sense cannot disagree of that they are wrong for that.  

Democrats don't ask for reform. They want to totally change the country. I don't believe America is an evil country. Do you think America is evil? Was our founding bad? Do we deserve to hurt?

I was a reluctant Trump supporter in 2016. I didn't vote for him in the primary. I supported him because the alternate was worse. He has been much better than I thought. You seem to have a prejudice against Trump, his voters, and the energy industry. Why do you hate me and people like me? My brother works on an offshore oil platform.

With that said, there’s no way anybody can convince me that Trump is worse than not just Democrat’s in general but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris specifically. Amongst all the terrible ideas on his gun policy webpage his one pissed me off the most:


“End the online sale of firearms and ammunitions. Biden will enact legislation to prohibit all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits, and gun parts.”

This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment.”

Why would someone so heavily criticize one system  and then immediately attempt use it to sabotage an election? Notice how the article doesn't say anything about how the machines were removed other than as a result of GOP policy. The American Postal Worker Union has publicly endorsed Joe Biden as a presidential candidate. The people who removed these machines were in all likelihood Postal Service employees.

8/19/2020,"I would disagree. The click bait articles do warp people’s minds. And it does leave a impact. Coworkers are constantly sharing news between each other, that is only reported on social media. Then claim that the media won’t air it because it exposes the media as being corrupt. 

Like for instance. Antifa . Com. 
It linked to joe Biden campaign page. Anyone can create a website and set up links for anything. But this ran like wildfire for days along people at work. And it even got so popular Fox News and a few other media outlets ran it as a story. Now the website is down, and has been looked into, like who owns it, how long has it been active, who owned it before for hand. Go figure, it was only active for 2-4 months. Last active like 10 years ago. And who owns it? Russia, and now Panama.  But it spread the damage, it spread the misinformation. It creates a horrible image for one candidate, and it was all fake. But it won’t matter that it was fake. Because it already did what it was made to do. 

And this happens a lot. I know people don’t think it does because it does not effect them. But there has to be about 20-40% of the population in the USA that does No critical thinking at all when it comes to what they read.",-0.1538

Because hate to tell you, if Trump wins there will be no uprising from people fed up with it.  I mean with all the evil him and his administration has done no one that can stop him has.

And you might want to get clarification and context in the claims it is easy to say ‘she is evil’ and not bother looking into the details.

For example I presume the DNA case you are talking about was the Cooper case which she had nothing to do with.  From the second linked below

&gt; Kamala Harris played no role whatsoever in the Kevin Cooper case for several reasons: 1) Convicted of four murder counts in 1983, Cooper had exhausted all of his court appeals in November 2009 which was prior to Harris taking office as AG; 2) Cooper’s only recourse left was clemency which is solely within the Governor’s powers.

Again if you don’t like the system and that it was purely in the purview of the Governor then you need to change the system.

Tulsi Gabbard: “[Kamala Harris] kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.”

The facts: It’s false to say Harris kept prisoners incarcerated beyond their sentences. Lawyers in Harris’ attorney general office did unsuccessfully argue against the early release of prisoners, citing needed inmate firefighting labor — but Harris said they did so without her knowledge and publicly criticized the statement at the time.

In September 2014, attorneys for Harris argued in a court filing that the state should not free some prisoners as part of efforts to reduce prison crowding because it would negatively impact programs that put inmates to work fighting wildfires. That would “severely impact fire camp participation — a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought,” the lawyers wrote. A judge ruled against Harris’ office’s request.

The Democratic Party has been the ones pouring gasoline in this instance. Trump says a lot of stupid things, but he doesn’t implicitly or explicitly encourage his supporters to violently attempt to overthrow the government in the name of equality.

All of it played on a racist trope that goes back generations in American culture and has a complicated history in forging gender identity, power and class. The “angry Black woman” remains a cultural and social fixture, a stereotype that has been used to denigrate artists, athletes and political figures.

“The notion of the angry Black woman was a way — is a way — of trying to keep in place Black women who have stepped outside of their bounds, and who have refused to concede the legitimacy of being a docile being in the face of white power,” said Michael Eric Dyson, a Georgetown professor and author.]

Let that sink in: Joe Biden blatantly admitting and joking about, with zero ambiguity, leveraging a billion dollar loan guarantee of American federal dollars to have a prosecutor fired that’s looking into the dirty dealings of a dirty company his dirty son works for.

ObamaCare was an objective disaster and if you cant see that youre blind.   JoJo's plan makes the healthcare industry accountable to their customers: *the people*, instead of bureaucrats.
