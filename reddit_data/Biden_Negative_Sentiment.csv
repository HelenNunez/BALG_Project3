8/6/2020,"You are a moron who is either simply a moron or you’re deliberately misinterpreting what I’m saying. I don’t think Black votes are “controlled” by anyone. I’m opposed to the Republican Party cynically using an unstable man to take away votes from Joe Biden. Repeat after me before you just keep making the same dumb argument over and over again. 

Now you can vote how you want to vote, but acting like the Republican Party helping an obviously unstable person get on ballots isn’t a cynical ploy just doesn’t make sense (unless, again, you’re down with Republicans in the first place). I really need you to get this through your head. I’m simply disturbed by Republicans cynically taking advantage of Kanye and how offensive this is in fact to Black people. If Republicans actually cared maybe they’d put forth a stable Black conservative, who doesn’t have a history of public meltdowns.

8/12/2020,"If the supporters of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were a venn-diagram, it would be a circle. Joe Biden's campaign has zero enthusiasm behind it -- the only enthusiasm comes from beating Trump.

If 2016 has proved *anything*, it's that politics is not what it used to be. The worst thing you can be isn't a trainwreck, but forgettable. Biden is forgettable, Kamala is forgettable -- I can't remember a single positive memorable thing either one has done on the campaign trail. Well -- there was Kamala roasting Biden, but I don't think that's a positive in this specific situation.

I hate Trump. I hate his policies. I hate what he's done to the country. But he will always command larger crowds, build more excitement than Biden and Kamala on his worst days.

Sarah Palin is, I suppose, the counterpoint, right? Dumb Sarah Palin, blowing her interview with Katie Couric and dooming McCain. But Obama was ahead in that election every single step of the way. A ticket of, like, McCain/Romney in 08 would've been just as successful, and having a hardcore conservative to counterpoint the milquetoast McCain probably brought in more voters than it scared away.",-0.1740

I’m not saying there aren’t bad cops, just that the vast majority are a reflection of their training and the orders they are given. 

A lot of those protests have had criminals using the protest as a means to incite violence. 

The militarization can be tied to a few things; federal government offloading their equipment to localities in order to transfer a small portion of their debt, a method of protecting the individual behind the uniform from dangerous threats, and a means to increase their combat efficiency against active shooters, drug dealers/traffickers etc. 

I would rather the underlying issues be addressed.. if criminality can be tied to poverty then let’s address poverty. If the drugs can be stopped from entering the country than let’s increase efforts to prevent them from ever making it into our communities. 

If police tactics are the issue then perhaps we should change how they operate.

Trump has done terrible things, but I suppose it *is* possible for Joe Biden to do something worse. I would still worry that the GOP remaining in power would cause egregious harm to the nation, but while I cannot seemingly influence the GOP to stop supporting a criminal in Trump, I *could* withdraw my support from the Democrats if they were supporting a worse criminal.

Alternately, Donald Trump could strongarm Mitch McConnell into passing a carbon tax to fight climate change and raise taxes on the rich while increasing the minimum wage, then confess to his various violations of the Constitution and tax evasion and other crimes, dump damning evidence of all the people in government who are doing illegal things, then resign, then refuse to cut a plea deal but instead insist on serving a prison sentence for his various crimes, and then apologize for his vilifying of people who were politically opposed to him. If he did all that, I might consider voting for a Republican this fall.

#Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook continues to let Trump spread outright lies with no accountability. In June, the Trump campaign began posting an ad to Facebook claiming Joe Biden wanted to defund the police even though he never took that position — and all five of Facebook’s independent fact-checkers deemed the claim to be false. But thanks to Facebook’s lax rules regarding political speech, ads containing the claim weren’t marked as false or taken down — instead, the Trump campaign has shown versions of the lie on Facebook at least 22.5 million times in over 1,440 different ads. Facebook pocketed between $350,000 and $553,000 for letting Trump blast his propaganda uncritically.

#We saw in 2016 the devastating consequences that rampant disinformation can have on our democracy. Sadly, it appears Mark Zuckerberg couldn’t care less. He’s more concerned about pandering to Trump and his sprawling network of right-wing sycophants than he is about protecting our democracy.

But you’re explicitly **not** saying that: you’re arguing that **the Bible** says abortion is wrong.

If you want to argue “Joe Biden is a bad Catholic,” then I would not argue with you. I can not determine who qualifies as a good Catholic: the Pope and other authorities do that. But, if you want to argue that he’s a bad Christian then, well, that’s difficult: because there are a million different kinds of Christian and they all believe different things. So, you have to say **why** you believe he’s a bad Christian. And, you say because the Bible says abortion is wrong (which is doesn’t, at least not explicitly).

While you can twist a verse here and there to *argue* that abortion is wrong, there is nothing in the Bible that explicitly states that abortion is wrong. And, when it comes to determining how the verses in the Old Testament are supposed to be interpreted, *Ancient* Jewish sources are extremely relevant. The Ancient Jews wrote the Old Testament. Every verse would’ve been written in the context of their history. The Jews developed the Midrash explaining the verses. And so on.

You can say “abortion is murder” all you want, but it’s not explicit in the Bible. This is backed up by the fact that the Jews believe no such thing (covering the Old Testament), and Jesus never said otherwise (covering the New Testament).

The President can literally issue a never ending stream of illegal executive orders and administrative directives faster than they can be struck down.  As far as I can tell, he could sign an administrative order instructing the Secret Service to assassinate Joe Biden, and it would have the force of law for at least as long as it took to challenge it in court (probably at least an hour).

This is about criticizing as fiercely and loudly as possible the system that left the only viable choices for president as Donald Trump and Joe Biden, two dementia-addled septuagenarians with credible rape allegations against them and a history of overt bigotry and misogyny. Perseverating over the relative nature and degree of the red flags against them is useless and irrelevant. Neither should be anywhere near the levers of power, and the fact that they are is a devastating admonition of the current status quo.

The real message for anyone vaguely progressive is this: Of the viable candidates for president, Joe Biden is the better choice, and that's utterly disgraceful.

Trump is corrupt too.

That's not to mention his pardoning of every single one of his friends to protect them from criminal prosecution.

And you think Joe Biden panders to his base? Wait till you see the guy who uses state forces to clear protestors from an area so he can pose with the Bible in front of a church to please evangelical Christians. The guy who couldnt bring himself to condemn white supremacists marching in Charlottesville for 3 days because they were fans of him until he was forced to read a prepared statement by his own party, which he then clumsily walked back anyway saying there was blame on both sides.

We know the third reason why Trump is bad - he's an utterly incompetent moron who alienates US rivals, who has no grasp on foreign policy and who riles up political conflict throughout America with his rhetoric.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides all of those, during Biden's vice presidency, the Obama administration:

* Repealed 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'
* Signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, adding gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity as protected demographics against hate crimes.
* Signed Executive Order 13672, which added sexuality and gender identity as protected groups with regards to governmental hiring. 
* Extended the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to also apply to same-sex couples.
* Appointed the first lesbian U.S. Marshal and the first transgender government official *ever*.
* Appointed two of the five justices that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.

That's not a great example but the two cops were charged with felony assault so the system worked in that example. 

&gt;I’m not the one generalizing protestors, I admit and agree they do instigate every so often. I will admit I do not have data on this, because data about who instigated an act of force is not often collected. 

I fully agree, I'm not trying to generalize either side. They both have extreme examples that are indefensible. 

&gt;At any rate, we cannot say for certain who participates in these protests, /u/seldomseeninlife suggesting that Joe Biden, maybe (I still haven’t seen what tweet or source he’s basing this opinion on) supporting these protests means that he has connections to the radical left is just ludicrous. Many people in those protests aren’t radical, they just don’t want to see a semi-fascist state take over America.

The Presidency is not a place, it is a person. The moment Joe Biden is sworn in, which can be done anywhere, he will be the President and Trump will be a private citizen.

what does help **the right** build their empire (which is happening, **provably**, with the blatant, well-reported militarisation of the police) is your pinochet-lite position of **authoritarianism** and **censorship**. what helps the richest men on earth to consolidate **power** is your love of the market. what helps the thinktanks and lobbyists to puppeteer the state is your willingness to gobble up their lies.

all you know is your immediate experience of the world, and the spoonfed bits of propaganda to put it all together. you don't know how society works, what happens in it, and why. the system is a mythical realm of political entities to you, and a set of very clear material forces to me or anybody else that's ever heard anything about marxism.

if your idea of freedom involves millions and millions of people working in fast food or customer service and hating every minute of it, then your idea of freedom has nothing to do with freedom, and it should go away. if your idea of freedom involves the fucking police committing war crimes against citizens, then your idea of freedom has nothing to do with freedom and should go away.

It's all about banning things, not about the follow-through on the holes in our system that either cause problems for legal gun owners or problems that lead to guns in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. The current system is sluggish, expensive, increasingly litigation-based, and wholly ineffective. Trump has also had a piss-poor track record on 2nd amendment legislation and wobbles constantly on what he supports and doesn't support depending on when the NRA *(fuck that organization)* gives him a visit. It's enough to piss off any proponents of common sense gun laws, so it's not like either of them are on the side of rationality here.

Yes he is a bigot. Yes he is certainly a traitorous liar. Yes, he is incredibly destructive. But people will still vote for him. Why? Because, like it or not, a very large portion of Americans are Christians and Conservatives. These groups are not OK with Globalism or Gay marriage necessarily - it is their right to hold those opinions. Trump plays to those demographics: he is a serious (beating protesters serious) Evangelical, and quite obviously a conservative. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has not built his campaign around religion, and is not a conservative. Therefore, Christians and conservatives are less likely to vote for him.

I don't believe in a god, but they do. Does that make them stupid? no, of course not. I'm not a conservative, but I know people who are. They're not idiots, or evil. They are just people with different opinions than mine. Why should I insult them for that?

7/27/2020,"[Joe Biden](https://brasil.elpais.com/noticias/joseph-biden/) estava fora da [disputa eleitoral nos EUA ](https://brasil.elpais.com/noticias/elecciones-eeuu/)na noite de 22 de fevereiro. Aos 77 anos, sua carreira política tinha terminado para a imprensa naquele dia em que, depois de ser derrotado nas primárias de Iowa e de New Hampshire, ficou em segundo em Nevada, a 26 pontos de [Bernie Sanders](https://brasil.elpais.com/noticias/bernard-sanders/). Ele subiu ao palco, deu seu sorriso mais profissional e disse a seus seguidores: “A imprensa sempre se apressa em declarar as pessoas mortas. Mas estamos vivos, estamos reagindo e vamos ganhar!”. Uma semana depois, arrasou na Carolina do Sul. Na Superterça, em 3 de março, todos os moderados do Partido Democrata se uniram em torno dele e o transformaram em um candidato inalcançável.

Este fim de semana marca a contagem regressiva de 100 dias para as eleições presidenciais de 3 de novembro nos Estados Unidos. Biden é o candidato in pectore do Partido Democrata. Está pactuando sua agenda com Sanders para não deixar para trás nenhum voto progressista. Mas, além disso, parece estar ampliando sua base para praticamente todos os grupos demográficos, em todos os Estados-chave. Há um mês, [Biden está na frente do presidente Donald Trump em todas as pesquisa](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-07-22/a-100-dias-das-eleicoes-e-atras-de-biden-nas-pesquisas-trump-inicia-empreitada-midiatica.html) de abrangência nacional. Esta é a radiografia da campanha quando faltam 14 semanas para uma eleição crucial:

### Média de 8,8 pontos de vantagem

Desde 26 de junho foram publicadas 15 pesquisa sobre as preferências em nível nacional nos Estados Unidos, segundo a [contagem do portal RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html#polls). Biden está na frente em todas. Sua vantagem é, na média, de 8,8 pontos. Na sondagem mais apertada, aparece com 2 pontos de dianteira. Na mais generosa, com 15 (52 a 37). As pesquisas nacionais não são muito úteis para prever a vitória em um país tão grande e com um sistema político tão fragmentado, como se viu em 2016, quando[ Donald Trump derrotou Hillary Clinton](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/11/09/internacional/1478660050_114058.html). Mas servem para captar o tom geral da simpatia do país por um ou outro candidato à Casa Branca. Neste momento, a questão é quanta vantagem tem Biden, mas não há dúvida de que ele está na liderança.

### Na frente em todos os Estados-chave

Em 3 de novembro não será realizada apenas uma eleição presidencial, serão realizadas 50, uma em cada Estado e cada uma com idiossincrasias e demografias distintas. A definição depende de um punhado de Estados médios, que são os que podem pender para um ou outro lado. Todas as análises coincidem em que os Estados que contam agora são Pensilvânia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Carolina do Norte, Arizona e Flórida. Nos quatro primeiros, Trump venceu de forma surpreendente há pouco mais de três anos e meio, em alguns por uma margem muito estreita. Arizona e Flórida são uma incógnita. Segundo as pesquisas do último mês, Biden está em um [bom momento de sua campanha, liderando em todos os Estados-chave](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-06-26/biden-decola-nas-pesquisas-contra-um-trump-enfraquecido-pela-crise.html).

### Apoio de Biden é mais diversificado

O raciocínio por trás da escolha de Joe Biden como candidato democrata era o de que poderia se conectar com todos os grupos demográficos e socioeconômicos do país, algo que outros candidatos do partido não poderiam garantir. As pesquisas lhe dão vantagem em quase todos os grupos analisados. A sondagem NBC/WSJ do dia 15, por exemplo, apontou que o ex-vice-presidente supera Trump amplamente entre os negros (80 a 6), os latinos (67 a 22), os eleitores de 18 a 34 anos (62 a 23), as mulheres (58 a 35) e os eleitores brancos com estudos universitários (53 a 38). Trump leva vantagem entre o total de pesquisados brancos (49 a 42) e de homens (45 a 43). O único grupo em que parece ter ampla influência é o dos brancos sem estudos universitários (57 a 35).

### Questões-chave: economia, raça, saúde

Quando começou a campanha, condicionada agora [pela pandemia por coronavírus](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-06-26/biden-decola-nas-pesquisas-contra-um-trump-enfraquecido-pela-crise.html), as pesquisa perguntavam a respeito da economia. Na pergunta sobre quem é melhor para administrá-la, Trump ainda aparece na frente de Biden em algumas pesquisas, mas a margem está diminuindo à medida que se estende a paralisação econômica em meio à emergência de saúde. Em todas as outras questões, Biden inspira mais confiança. Por exemplo, uma sondagem da Universidade Quinnipac (Connecticut) no dia 15 mostrou que os entrevistados confiam mais no democrata do que em Trump para administrar uma crise econômica (57 a 38), para gerir a saúde (58 a 35), para combater a pandemia de Covid-19 (59 a 35) e para dar resposta às desigualdades raciais no país (62 a 30). Os números são consistentes em quase todas as pesquisa.

### Empatia do candidato

Donald Trump não despertava especial simpatia em 2016. Estes últimos anos à frente da Casa Branca não melhoraram essa imagem. No capítulo das qualidades pessoais, o candidato Biden está à frente do mandatário em qualquer variável. As pesquisa revelam que Biden tem mais apoio entre os democratas do que Trump entre os republicanos. Além disso, os eleitores que se definem como independentes também preferem Biden. O democrata ganha em todas as qualidades que se esperam de um candidato a governar a superpotência. Por exemplo, a pesquisa ABC/Washington Post do dia 19 perguntou: quem é mais honesto e confiável; entende melhor os problemas de pessoas como você; tem melhor personalidade e temperamento para a presidência; tem melhor ideia sobre o que os EUA devem representar; representa melhor seus valores pessoais; tem maior probabilidade de unir os americanos, em vez de dividi-los. Biden ganha em todas. Trump só empata (45 a 45) na pergunta sobre quem é um líder mais forte.

### Força no financiamento da campanha

A campanha de Biden era minúscula nas primárias democratas, em comparação com o forte movimento de arrecadação de Trump nos últimos anos, nos quais nunca deixou de levantar dinheiro. Isso já não é assim. Biden tinha 88 milhões de dólares (460 milhões de reais) em março, e agora tem 279 milhões de dólares (1,46 bilhão de reais). Trump arrecadou 342 milhões de dólares (1,79 bilhão de reais). A brecha da arrecadação está se fechando. Em junho, [a campanha de Biden levantou 63 milhões de dólares (330 milhões de reais](https://brasil.elpais.com/internacional/2020-06-09/biden-sai-da-toca-e-passa-a-acao-para-mostrar-uma-lideranca-alternativa-a-trump.html)), em comparação com 55 milhões de dólares (288 milhões de reais) do republicano. Quanto ao dinheiro disponível em caixa, o último relatório da Comissão de Finanças Eleitorais (FEC), divulgado em 22 de julho, revela que os dois chegam a agosto quase empatados: a campanha de Trump tem 113 milhões de dólares (591 milhões de reais) e a de Biden, 109 milhões de dólares (570 milhões de reais). Além desses totais, existe o dinheiro arrecadado pelos partidos e pelos grupos de grandes doadores anônimos. Biden já somou quase tanto dinheiro quanto Hillary Clinton neste momento da campanha de 2016. Trump, no dobro de tempo, está prestes a alcançar o total de[ Barack Obama ](https://brasil.elpais.com/noticias/barack-obama/)em 2012.",-0.1259
8/5/2020,"You mean the woman who lied about her story multiple times as we as her friends recounting from “they never heard her mention it” to “she may have mentioned it” to “she said it was biden”.  
   
Also the complete lack of any evidence otherwise. There’s no evidence of any complaint filed and the fucking GOP led senate wouldn’t say if they have any complaint to release (likely because they don’t. If they did they wouldn’t hesitate to release it).  Also happened in likely the busiest hallway in congress with no one having any recollection of any event remotely close to that occurring?

8/2/2020,"I feel the same way.  I've seen some older relatives suffer - not from Alzheimer's specifically, but definitely from dementia and overall cognitive decline - and die miserable and horrible deaths.  My only hope is that they were not aware of what was going on, but you never know what is going on inside the mind and body of another person.  It's a big fear of my own.

But, some bad news that I either read or heard, either here on Reddit or on one of the many podcasts that I listen to, is that most people who have dementia when they die don't actually die from the dementia.  Usually the dementia taxes the body and organs to the point of failure, and the person dies in pain, not even knowing why they are in pain, and not having the ability to tell others that they are in pain.  It gave me the shivers just typing out that sentence.

I never liked Joe Biden, and I would never vote for him anyway, but what the Democrats are doing to this man is cruel, and I feel for him.  I think, in hindsight, it will be seen as having been inhumane what they are doing to him right now, and that makes me very angry.

I think that, if we have the normal type of convention presidential debates, Trump will read the situation correctly, and respond appropriately.  But, I see the Democrats just pushing Joe Biden out there and hoping for the best.

One of the conspiracy theories right now on how the Democrats will get a different candidate into the presidential election, instead of Joe Biden, is that they are hoping Joe Biden does fail miserably, and blaming his decline, will see that as an opportunity to insert a different candidate that they actually want, like Hillary Clinton or Andrew Cuomo.",-0.1251

I'm not sure if you're actually this stupid or if this is bait, but I'll bite. Trump doesn't control the pandemic. The vast majority of deaths came from nursing homes, I don't have the exact figure but it was well over 60%. The majority of these, were in NYC, where Cuomo's dumbass made it mandatory for nursing homes to accept covid positive patients. Even Trump's strongest democratic opponents have thanked him for getting them the supplies they need, including Newsom and Cuomo. He sent the Navy ship to NYC, Cuomo decided not to use it. He built a 10,000 bed hospital in NYC almost overnight. Lastly, trump doesn't control a disease. What a banal comment overall.

Edit: I'll add to this that Trump banned travel from China within a week of the first case in the USA and was called racist and xenophobic for it by the media and Democrats, including Biden himself. How many more thousands would have been infected and died if Biden was President? Wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings and be *gasp* racist!

The Democrat party is far more united now that Biden has Sanders’ endorsement and is working with him *AND* Ocasio-Cortez. Even people who might not be all that fond of Biden are still very energized to vote for him if only to get Trump the fuck OUT. 

Meanwhile there’s far more *dis*unity and infighting in the GOP, as the Republicans can tell that their polls are sinking since voters are tired of Trump’s shit and the party enabling everything he does, refusing to ever go against him. Now every time Trump does or says something stupid they end up caught in a bind - Go against Trump, and incur the wrath of him and his base, or fall in line and piss off the Republican voters leaving the party to either vote for Biden or just not vote at all?

That's what the accusation is though. Trump's significant financial ties to Russia if not some kind of blackmail, which also seems reasonable to me given how depraved Trump is, made him vulnerable to influence by the same criteria that we routinely recruit intelligence moles with. I'm not saying they have sway over the democrats in some way or are controlling our elections or are the only country influencing those elections now that it's obvious we're voting for Harpers Ferry. Putin isn't a geopolitical joker so much as he is a tin-pot dictator of a failed state whose GDP is half that of California's, but the documented interactions between Russia and Trump and his personality and desperate need to embrace anyone resembling a father figure all make the core allegations seem plausible if not probable that Putin could rope in one dumbass who ended up elected because of failures of our system. 

The point where I break from liberals is that they offload all of those failures of our system to Russia. Those bad things are happening because we're a bad country with two bad political parties, but liberals refuse to admit that because they're naive/evil and privileged.

8/5/2020,"&gt; But Trump is doing incredible amounts of damage to norms of politics

Even in 4 more years Trump would be hard-pressed to do more damage than Joe did as 1 of 100 Senators and as VP for 8 years. Joe's record as a Senator - without executive power - was fucking horrendous. Wars, systemic racism, systemic sexism, private prison explosion, the list is **very** long.

&gt; Okay, so who is worse? Donald trump or Joe Biden?

It depends on your point of view. What is your #1 policy priority? Mine is war. Trump has been more horrendous with drones after Obama was horrendous on drones. But Trump *has not* ramped up the war in Syria that Obama/Biden started despite to invade. Our illegal occupation is bad enough. Trump *has not* destroyed a country as Obama/Biden did with Libya. Trump did try de-escalation with NK. On the negative side, Trump backed out of the Iran deal, which is (IMO) tied with his worst foreign policy action of killing the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Trump has generally kept boots off the ground while ramping up our foreign terror program of illegal drone bombings. He also resisted heavy pressure to retaliate for Iran's downing of our drone (probably over their airspace).

Biden cheerled the effort to go into Iraq illegally and defended it publically afterward. He is just as authoritative as Trump, he is just not as stupid and hamhanded as Trump in his efforts (Trump being an incompetent moron makes this a low bar). Biden has been for every single military engagement except the surge in Afghanistan. Biden would (like Clinton) be far more hawkish than Trump.

Foreign Policy and military action is where a president has the most power. 

Domestically I think Biden would be better, but domestically Congress and the courts have more power. Congress - particularly the House - has financial authority. Authority Pelosi **is not using in any way to stop Trump** so a president Biden might be slightly better, but we're talking marginal difference here. 

A non-vote is not a vote for Trump. That logic is false and intellectually insulting. No one fucking owns my god damn vote. A vote for no one does not add a vote for Trump.

I am not seeing how Larry Summers, Joe Biden's economic advisor and the same asshole from the 2008 banking and housing collapse turns this around.

The Democrats could have the presidency and both houses of Congress, eliminate the filibuster, and still the only thing they will accomplish is Bipartisan Deficit Reduction and handing the Social Security Trust fund over to Banks and Hedge Funds.  

All in preparation to hand the Congressional majority back over to the Republicans in 2022.

I don't see how we will be saved is when Joe Biden finally achieves his dream of cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 

I haven't seen a single policy from Joe Biden that will resolve the pandemic and economy. He opposes UBI and Medicare for all.

I don't see how electing Democrats stops pointless wars and oversees adventures when they are total tools of the Military Industrial Complex and Banks.

I don't see how we will be saved when Joe Biden allows 30 million people to be evicted in the middle of a pandemic. He was Vice-President and didn't speak for the 5.1 million who were evicted after 2008. 

The only real argument is we need to replace our current Game Show Host President is because he miserably botched the pandemic response (which is totally true). 

The problem being the Democrats also were incompetent (Cuomo), have never opposed funding Trump's policies, and also signed the horrible CARES and HEROES acts like the Republicans.

7/31/2020,"Why do we subscribe to social constructs (like gender) when they’re all somewhat harmful and ultimately pointless? Because we live in a society. The fact that we know that we live in a society doesn’t exempt us from being influenced by it, or from existing within its bounds. An example: most of the time our choices when voting for POTUS are bad. We vote anyways, because sometimes one of the choices makes us feel less bad (AKA, voting for Joe Biden because Trump is XYZ evil thing of the week). 

To answer the larger question of “why are people still gendered if gender is fake,” the reality is that social constructs ARE real, the same way credit and calendars and languages are real. We don’t stop using times and dates just because we know they aren’t intrinsic to the universe (or even to all of humanity); we still need to keep track of what we’ve done and what we’re going to do. Sex &amp; gender is a lot like that; yeah, it’s not “real,” and the huge number of intersex and nonbinary/trans people confirm it. But we still want to communicate how we feel about our place in the world; man, woman, something else. 

I guess in fewer words, what I’m trying to say is: you can reasonably say gender is performative, and that gender performance is based on our intrinsic sense of place in the world, and that gender performance is harmful and meaningless, and none of those things are necessarily contradictory or mean that we should all stop using gendered pronouns.

CatholicVote, a conservative faith-based advocacy group, requested that Biden, who is a Catholic, “publicly condemn the disturbing rise in attacks on Catholic symbols, churches, statues, and beliefs.”

The advocacy group said there’s recently been an “alarming number [of] arson-related church fires, desecration of sacred symbols and statues by extremist mobs [and] hate-filled rhetoric of leading members of the Democratic Party.”

The Catholic group pointed to two fires being set at the entrance of a Massachusetts church over the weekend, which a Catholic leader called an “appalling act of arson against a house of worship,” the Boston Herald reported. 

CatholicVote also cited a fire set inside the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala, Fla. last month and another blaze at the Mission’s San Gabriel Arcángel that damaged much of the 215-year-old building.

The organization also criticized that protesters had vandalized statues, including ones of St. Junipero Serra in California, and that a statue of the Virgin Mary was set on fire in Boston. 

CatholicVote President Brian Burch accused Biden of saying “nothing [as] Catholic churches across America are literally burning.” 

“Leading members of the Democratic Party have fueled a climate of hate against Catholics, and these attacks have now led to acts of vandalism and violence,” Burch said in a statement. “These attacks on the Church raise serious questions about the commitment of Joe Biden, a self-professed Catholic, to stand up to the rising climate of anti-Catholicism across the country.”

Joe Biden’s brother and son have a long history of profiting off his name

By Ryan Grim
October 15, 2019 | 4:49pm



Joe Biden (left) and his son Hunter BidenReuters

While Democrats want the press and voters to concentrate on President Trump’s phone call with Ukraine, “the problem for Democrats is that a review of Hunter Biden’s career shows clearly that he, along with Joe Biden’s brother James, has been trading on their family name for decades, cashing in on the implication — and sometimes the explicit argument — that giving money to a member of Joe Biden’s family wins the favor of Joe Biden,” argues Ryan Grim at The Intercept. Trump’s behavior may be shameless, Grim says, but that doesn’t mean Biden’s history isn’t an issue, he writes in this excerpt:
In trading on his father’s name and power to advance his career, Hunter Biden is following in the footsteps of James Biden, Joe’s younger brother.

&gt;[It began small. In 1973, one year after Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at age 29, James Biden opened the nightclub Seasons Change with what Politico, referencing contemporaneous local reporting in Delaware, called “unusually generous bank loans.”
When James ran into trouble, Joe, as a senator, later complained that the bank shouldn’t have loaned James the money. “What I’d like to know,” Biden told the News Journal in 1977, “is how the guy in charge of loans let it get this far.” The paper investigated, and sources at the bank said that the loan was made because James was Joe’s brother.](

7/28/2020,"&gt; I have no idea why the fuck Biden is so controversial to people.

He was popular until at least 2018. Just find old YouTube clips and see the comments. Then a lot of people worked hard to tear him down in mostly bad faith ways because he was leading in the polls. For a year the media presicted collapse. Opposing candidates called him or insinuated that he was [corrupt](https://youtu.be/RBXTfskVE_o), [racist](https://www.wsj.com/video/kamala-harris-calls-out-joe-biden-over-racial-issues/DAA0D8FE-AF38-47A0-A8F6-E1B6E04B2BFC.html), [republican](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/warren-derides-biden-as-running-in-wrong-presidential-primary), and [one even tried to claim he had dementia in a debate](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/13/castro-questioned-bidens-memory-1494495). The only people who I've seen really hate Biden are under 25s who have little memory of the Obama years or before because it makes sense. If that's how I was introduced to him I'd probably hate him too. 

I think the more candidates base their campaign strategy around slander the weaker the party becomes. For every candidate there are a lot of genuine things to criticize or polices to critique. We don't need bad faith attacks and purity tests [the accusers don't even pass to become the norm.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/12/19/buttigieg_vs_warren_on_wine_cave_fundraiser_youre_issuing_purity_tests_you_cannot_yourself_pass.html) Frankly only such a known quantity like Biden could get out of such a primary as a strong candidate. I like Buttigieg as well but if all people heard about him from the major candidates was that he was a wall street sellout (because the financial industry is pure evil) who is racist, a manipulator, and a fake gay then the race would be way tighter than it is now.",-0.1096

7/30/2020,"&gt;With 18 days until the Democratic convention begins, it’s anyone’s guess whom Joe Biden picks as his running mate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kamala Harris? Elizabeth Warren? Karen Bass? Susan Rice? Val Demings? Someone else?  
&gt;  
&gt;But  at least if recent history is any guide, the safe bet is that Biden’s  selection will be pretty conventional — when it comes to experience,  qualifications and name identification.

Biden will probably pick Harris.  The worst thing about her is that she called Biden on his prior policy failings.  Biden could use someone around him willing to tell him when he's wrong.",-0.1093
8/2/2020,"I think a measured approach would be if you like Joe Biden, don't gloss over the absolutely terrible stuff he actually did politically, but try to make sure it's corrected and he doesn't go off again on something terrible.  This is a fine stance for someone to have, and doesn't absolve the man for helping create the modern police state, which isn't a necessary mental jump you need to like him for then Trump anyways.",-0.1093
7/26/2020,"Dude, since when do tankies hate prisons? Lol I am both a nihilist and a tankie apparently, because I am not wasting my breath criticizing and shaming people who are done waiting and hoping another black person wont be murdered by the police. 

I know you know that this is not an either or situation. I am not making any argument about Joe ‘the rapist’ Biden, or trump for that matter. The only argument I am making is that your argument is fuckin dumb. 

Your argument - people making a ruckus about black lives mattering is going to drive the poor middle-of-the-road voter into Trumps arms. It follows that they should do something else, tbd, but definitely not anything anyone could criticize. the vast majority of people who any of those arguments appeal to feel basically the same about any type of protest, not even to mention all of the ways in which the mass media creates narratives only geared towards upholding capital and white supremacy. They don’t care what actually happened. They fantasize about running you over with your car regardless of whether you’re in bloc or in a pussy hat. So, it follows that we should do nothing, because anything but obedience will be twisted. Do nothing and also vote. 

It is directly harmful to spread good protester - bad protester narratives. It makes everyone around not care that terrorism charges got slapped on people for nothing, because they will be labeled ‘bad protestor’. Doesn’t matter what they did, it matters who they are. Every time we parrot CNN here we are just setting our loved ones up for prison, disproportionately our loved ones of color. 

It is also just dumb to waste energy blaming other leftists for literally the repression of the state - like, bro, if no one ever set a trash can on fire, the violent apparatus of the state would not wither away. We are not the reason they do harm. Idk, blame the people actually responsible for the harm maybe?

8/4/2020,"&gt;guns et al makes it sound like a science lol.

I didn't say their convictions are science based or even that I agree with them. But unlike you I'm not calling to call them racist retards just because they believe in some deity that I don't.

&gt;i don't get how, if i am an unredeemable racist to you for having said some fucked up shit in a stupid post 6mo ago,

I didn't say you were irredeemable, I said your apology was insincere because you kept suggesting that you could have been taken out of context. If you're going to apologize then own it and don't be a little bitch about it. But now in your other post you started falling back on the 'well other people sometimes say racist things too' argument. 

&gt;if trump voters btw are not the 'basket of deplorables' they are either so clinically retarded or gullible 

So in the same way that you stereotyped black people as being slow, stupid and gullible, you're now stereotyping Republican voters as being racists, clinically retarded or gullible without any comprehension of the irony. I'd suggest that your problem is that you talk in broad generalizations and make pathetic excuses for your behavior.

&gt;you dont draw a line in the sand for anyone who can accept a candidate who endorses the confederate flag etc

I judge each individual based on their own actions. You said something racist so I called you out on it. I didn't use you saying something racist and make a broad assumption about everybody who speaks german also being racist. 

People have two shit candidates to pick from or they can vote 3rd party. I don't agree with it but I can understand why a good person who was brought up in a religious household would vote for Trump. Similarly, I don't agree with it but I can also understand why a good person would vote for Biden, even though he's done terrible things like writing the Patriot Act, voting for the Iraq War, worked with segregationists and lied about being a civil rights activist. Again I understand it - I don't agree with it. 

But if by your logic voting for Trump makes them automatically racists then so does voting for Biden. But I don't think that because again it's just broad stereotyping that lacks any nuance. However, that doesn't mean that as an individual that I have to vote for a racist candidate.

They're two fucked up choices and the parties have rigged the system to stop any other outside dissent, so I can understand their choices even if I don't agree with them, However, as overall I think those two major party voters are helping to erode our democracy by being passive participants so I'm not going to join them. 

But I also don't go to the Joe Biden or Donald Trump subs and troll them because of their political convictions or tell them to vote 3rd party. That's why I think the VBNMW types coming here to shit on progressive or shill for Biden are assholes.

&gt;it sure af is a stupid thing to say, but i am neither saying that i know better than them nor am i endorsing either alternative. i am merely speculating on the future course of events.

You weren't talking about drug users. You were talking about a whole race of people and suggested that they were slow and gullible. I agree with you that it was a stupid thing to say because it was racist but you're still making excuses.

&gt;well... for someone who is well aware of the systematic problems with elections in america, the corrupt nature of the political system etc thats sure naive af but if it helps you sleep...

The same Democrats that say Trump is an idiot and they'll drag him out of the white house are the same ones saying he's an political mastermind and he'll successfully overthrow the government.

8/5/2020,"I think you are wrong.  I thoroughly dislike Joe Biden but I actually think he is the perfect candidate to beat Trump.  

Trumps game plan was going to be make his opponent seem like a radical lefty socialist coming for your guns, god, and money no matter who he was facing.  That allegation just doesnt stick well to Biden.  He is the most middle of the road non threatening politician.  His stumbling and muttering paints the picture of a guy who even if he was suddenly radicalized, couldnt get shit done anyways.

8/11/2020,"Do you mean Sanders himself, or his base?  To me, Sanders seems to just barely cross the line on how rebellious a good-standing Democrat can be.    


In '16 he endorsed and campaigned for Hillary - As I understand it, he was unprepared for some of the actions of his delegates at the convention that made a lot of the WithHer/StillWithHer crowd mad. 

This time, he's endorsed Joe, tried to work towards getting progressives to support the nomination,  tried to convince them that voting for Joe is necessary, and has congratulated Kamala on her VP pick.  He's touted the results of a non-binding unity policy panel that got so little movement from Biden, as to be clearly a show piece.  My guess is that he was entirely unsatisfied with the results of that initiative, but he hasn't said so, and I can guarantee he won't until after the election.

The left had been consistently disappointed by Sanders' unwillingness to really criticize Biden on stage.

The guy doesn't have any more respect or support for gun rights, or any of our protected rights for that matter, and will gladly change his opinions at the drop of a hat when convenient. The bumpstock ban is just one example, but it's not banning bumpstocks that was so scary about the decision, it was how it was done. Obama looked into banning them the exact same way, but was told it was beyond the scope of executive order by the ATF, which he respected. Trump was told the same thing, and pushed through with the ban anyway. When Trump pushes through illegal executive orders on gun control that even Obama found too far, that's a very serious issue.

The Democratic party has been soft on China, we delayed on the Iraq War drawdown, we must contend (somehow) with the fact that Americans are allergic to the very idea of paying taxes.

But Donny stands for nothing. He's waffled on so many of his policies and commitments, the only thing I know he stands for is 'WALL' and 'RETALIATION'. He's committed criminal offenses. He's facing criminal charges in the State of New York. It's possible there are sealed federal charges still hanging around from the Mueller investigation. He really did nearly send in United States Armed forces into American cities. This is all stuff that's been widely reported. The only part of my previous comment that was opinion were the last three sentences.

It really is that bad. Already. It's very hard to believe, but it's not funny. There's a reason Republicans are fleeing the party. There's a reason that decorated retired Generals are speaking out. There's a reason that Wall Street is embracing a Joe Biden candidacy.

Biden discussed it on camera because it was not a secret.  The quid pro quo was about removing a corrupt Ukrainian official.  There was no personal benefit to Biden or Obama.  (And no, said corrupt official was not investigating Biden's son.)

They don't want women to be able to have autonomy over their bodies. the current Republican president and the last one are laughing stocks worldwide for being blatantly stupid almost every time they speak. Their war on drugs put millions in jail for nonviolent crimes, many of them simply suffering from addiction or just having marijuana. They want to cut all the medical help people get who can't afford medicine.

And then they are also the ones who also claim to be all about God and Christianity. While they have no regard for the sick, the elderly, the less fortunate. So they are hypocrites, too. It seems like they use religion to hide how evil they really are.

But I guess a lot of Americans must be equally evil and stupid to vote them in so often. Though from what Ive read, it's less than half the population actually voted for Trump, as the election isn't done by popular vote and also you have non voters. Still must be a lot.

And then the best the other guys can come up with is Joe Biden. That guy is a joke too. Another dinosaur. Not an inspiring man or charismatic man. Obama at least made you believe he was a leader. I can't remember any other ones that seemed good in my lifetime, Clinton was a shyster who cheated on his wife, the Bushes were awful, Reagan was awful.

Tough on crime is stupid, cops should be protect and serve not harass and douche. They shouldnt being nothing more than a glorified tax collector. The war on drugs that he supports is a crime against humanity, and is used for nothing more than to discriminate against minorities to put them in prison.

Immigration has been intentionally used by both parties to undermine the middle class and line the pockets on Congress and the presidents. Deliberately making bad trade deals, importanting andything from labor to educational positions to tank wages, sky rockets tuition, and many other things. The whole immigration the a web of lies by both parties, and the Republicans who act like they are opposed to it are the ones who utilize this the most to fuck over Americans for a dollar in there pocket.

He picked a stance of which big hospital and pharmaceutical companies practically wrote the Bill's. Making medication and healthcare sky rocket and make it impossible for independent practices to make any money with out breaking the law or being slimey pieces of shit who shouldn't have a medical license. 

So he has not been middle on anything. Rather picked stances that have some of the wealthiest lobbyist and will makes him the most money.

7/31/2020,"Theoretical- bare with me as I don’t want this to happen.

Currently
Trump is having his dhs and blackwater goons take strategic posts in democratic run cities, and by October they will occupy DC full time. 
The DHS officers are in every city already and most of their leadership is in on this.



 Now until Late October:

Trump will create conflict to train his goons for their eventual post outside the White House.
When his poll numbers show him losing by 20 points, he will resort to arming his supporters to guard the White House and will insist that they are all service members. He will demand respect for these shit people.
 They will continue to beat veterans and mothers beyond the election but will honor freedom of speech for rascists, because that’s what they do.
Birds of a feather, right?



Late October to December:

Trump will attempt to move the election about two weeks prior, to confuse democrats into not voting. He will use direct mail campaigns through his election pacs to intentionally target democratic districts with bad information about when and where to vote.
He will additionally attempt to undermine the election by dismantling the post office through his postmaster general. 
This will ultimately be successful and many votes that were sent in late October won’t be counted until late December, early January.

In preparation, trump will suit his followers up as soldiers. He will claim they are feds but they are not.
They will commit terrible acts including eventually killing protesters. 
There will be no oversight and dissent will be quashed violently.
Many ordinary people will notice the bad behavior of these fake “soldiers” and ,in turn, will lose faith in the democratic process. 
Trump will encourage those who are newly jaded to follow him and take arms against his adversaries. Some will become secret police themselves. 
Some democrats and independents will join covertly creating an internal resistance.

When trump eventually loses in DECEMBER, he will claim China has destroyed our election process by helping the democrats. 
It will turn out, he told China to frame the dems for more friendly policy towards dictatorships.
He will frame it as a conspiracy and will order the arrest of Joe Biden over a frivolous charge with no discernible evidence.
Joe is arrested in December and he handles himself like a pimp as always.fuck the haters.

Trump will again make the case that we cannot elect a criminal.
He will describe a broken system and how only he can fix it.
Broken fucking record 


By March, we will have a fully escalated conflict overseas to keep our troops distracted while Trump finalizes his takeover of Congress.  

The secret police will by then be exposed as your meth-head neighbor Carl and the bad news bears of the kkk .
Dems will lose their shit and take to the streets.
Things will escalate, but violence is the new norm and people will be desensitized, saying stupid shit like ,” why do people always protest?”

45 will attempt to nominate another Supreme Court justice by any means possible, including arbitrarily changing the rules or harming a democratic justice.

They will eventually succeed and immediately push legislation to expand his presidential power. Separation of powers will no longer exist.
He will then jail all democrats in Congress and begin his plan to head south.

No, the post here is about the soft bigotry of lower standards. The left thinks that minorities aren’t as capable as everyone else and need their help to get by, which is a very racist opinion to have. 

BLM rioters have killed or injured more black people and destroyed minority owned businesses in the last few weeks than racist cops have in years. Let that sink in. And btw, your favorite democrat mayors condone the violence. I could also say that if the people under arrest didn’t fight back against the cops, they wouldn’t get killed, but that’s besides the point. If you were a cop and some thug was beating the shit out of you, I’m sure you’d try to straighten him out with your gun so that you dont die when a guy twice your weight has you sprawled out on the ground.

I think that discrimination against BIG PEOPLE by cops is a real thing. I used to shoot steroids and I'm a big mother fucker and I always get tossed around by cops who see me as a threat (just because they are six inches and 100 pounds lighter than me).  There was this one time this medium sized chinese copper tried to pick me up single handedly and manhandle me and carry me out of this hospital. All I wanted was medical treatment. And I literally had this cop tried to drag me around by grabbing me by one arm and start dragging. And I literally picked up that fat chinese prick with my single arm. I mean he just missed judges his strength I picked him up off the ground with one arm and then the next thing I know I eat pavement because ive got a half dozen cops and security guards overreact to me resisting arrest. I'm six foot 3 and 310 pounds and the chinese cop was probably 5 foot 10 and 210. Maybe he was 260 I dont know. But I dont think that it's TRUE that george floyd was bullied because he was black.

I hate violence. I'm sad that george floyd was killed. But I'm embarrassed that my jackass friends actually call it racism.

8/7/2020,"If by “all other forms of Christianity” you mean the right wing evangelical churches in the US that Trump is courting as part of his base, you would be right. 

Many Christian sects, including the Church of England and their associated organizations like the Episcopal Church etc., many Orthodox churches and mainline Protestant religions who have joined together in the ecumenical movement aspire to a closer relationship of all Christianity in the World Council of Churches. The Roman Catholic Church sends observers to their international meetings to promote mutual understanding. Together, the WCC and the RC Church represents 80% of the world’s Christians.

Most Evangelicals have their own, separate organization.

Anti Catholicism in America peaked in the 1840’s with the Know Nothings, but remnants of their hatred persists in the KKK and other fringe hate groups and is most definitely not a reflection of “all other forms of Christianity”. They tried and failed to prevent the election of John Kennedy and will fail in any attempt against Joe Biden.

Thankfully and unfortunately the democratic party is letting biden's campaign be a referendum on trump. The good, this keeps biden out of the public eye and keeps him from bleeding massive support every time he opens his mouth. It also forces republicans to 'try' and come up with something substantive to campaign on. You'll notice the GOP for the past 20 years has been the party of anti this and that (while behind the curtain looting as much money from the country as they can get away with). Additionally there are no reasons for biden to debate trump in this context. Trump mishandled literally every aspect of the presidency, but messing up the pandemic this bad has made it so obnoxiously obvious how poor republican policy making is that there is nothing to prove vs trump in a debate. IE, trump can sit there and sweat like a hog and flail about because his only strength is dragging dems into the mud and making them appear worse than he is. 

The bad of this strategy is of course that it makes the democratic base forget whats at stake. If we do not have a strong candidate out there championing the need for comprehensive healthcare reform, rent control, holding this admin to account for their crimes and dealing with the sheer amount of corruption that has come to a head these 3 years.... Well these things get swept under the rug and it sets a precedent for republicans that there IS so much they can get away with, instead of sending the message that republicans and their policy is not compatible with democracy and they have no place in our decision making. Secondly is the fact that our guy in the general IS joe biden and he is one gaffe away from sending precious precious votes home. Joe biden does not need to bring in democratic voters who turn out every 4 years. Joe biden does not need to reach across the aisle and steal trump's support (it will -NEVER- happen). Joe biden needs to make the case to the people who are disillusioned with the process and let them know that their voice has been heard. And unfortunately this is a metric of the voter block that joe is not capturing. But rather allowing the campaign to be a response to trump.

“There’s really only one question you need to ask yourself as you sit with all these aspirants for your old job. It’s not a pleasant question, but it is a necessary one.
Who has the emotional intelligence and humility to unite a leaderless country, should it come to that?

This is the one enormous thing we ask of a vice president, in rare moments, that we ask of no other leader in government. Should the worst occur, should the chair behind that big oak desk suddenly be vacant, the nation turns its gaze to someone it has barely considered before and asks that person to get us through.

This has nothing to do with knowing which foreign leaders to call or which bases to put on alert. This is about grace and warmth and political instinct. It’s about an understudy’s innate ability to be firm and decisive, while also understanding that the moment isn’t solely about her.”

Now whether the picture is racist or not, is a weird argument. Joe Biden is a white democrat who has been deemed an elitist by few. Him choosing a running mate of a different race would appeal to a larger group of people.

For you see, I’m actually an intellectual and for the better part of the last decade, I’ve been on a secret mission to awaken the hearts and minds of those around the world. 

During world war 2, we saw the rise of fascism and the harrowing effects of genocide. My mission was simply to expose that which has been quietly brooding beneath the surface of political discourse throughout my life.

I have behaved unlawfully, used crass and disgusting behavior. By doing so, I’ve drawn out the worst in our society and exposed them to the world. 

I will not accept a second term as president. I intend to work with Joe Biden to correct the actions I’ve taken over the past 4 years and if that opens me up to criminal liability, then so be it. 

Our world deserves better than the sham I sold you. Each of you must now open your eyes and reflect on the behavior you have shown over the last 4 years. There are many lessons to learn. 

Some of you have disavowed your family over support of me and for that, I am deeply troubled. We need a discourse in this country and we desperately need the ability to disagree on political policy. 

Where we cannot afford to disagree, even for a moment, is the message of our founding fathers. All men are created equal. 

Many will criticize my presidency for the work I have done to hurt and cripple the minorities and poorest in our society. It is true and it is my greatest personal shame and reverence. 

Be that as it may, I am hereby declaring that all my possessions and property hereby belong to those of you of whom I have wronged. 

Material possessions and money cannot replace the time and suffering my presidency have caused, but know this. My goal was always to make the world a better place. 

If I am to face imprisonment, I do so with open arms, knowing that from this day forward, I will no longer terrorize those who have sought to impede my wrath. 

I thank you for the opportunity to captivate the world and implore those of you who supported me desperately to reverse course. 

Remove the hatred from your hearts and search for peace with your fellow man. It may take days or weeks for you to realize what I’ve done, but the answer is simple. 

I’ve used tactics inspired by cult leaders, authoritarians, and dictators throughout history. It’s time for us all to turn the page and embrace a future that respects science and regales the educated.

When the Great Recession hit, and George W. Bush had been in office for nearly two terms, the GOP figured out a way to blame the Democrats.

See, the Democrats took over the House in January 2007 after they won the 2006 mid-term.  The Recession got underway in the latter half of 2007, and really got going in 2008.  Never mind who was President...it was all attributed to Barney Frank, Nancy Pelosi, Chris Dodd, etc.

What was it they did from January of 2007 until the crash to make it happen?  When I was arguing with idiots on the internet back in 2008, they never gave specifics, but they were sure the Democrats in Congress caused it all.

Rest assured, if Trump loses in November, the GOP will blame Joe Biden for anything bad that happens.  If Trump wins, anything bad that happens will all be Nancy Pelosi's fault.

I'll admit Trump says dumb things sometimes, but you often here the quite blown out of proportion and out of context pieces that MSM trains you to see. Literally half of what you listed were things that weren't true or taken out of context.

Like for fucks sake, the man said Yosemite different than most and MSM reports on it like he just killed a baby. All awhile Joe Biden is actually coming out and being a racist senile asshole that doesn't even think he's doing or saying anything wrong. He literally thinks he's in the 70s still. Yet that's ok.

Everyone here thinks I'm defending Trump directly when I'm not, I'm just tired of the super obvious dumb double standards that goes on all over the place.

7/25/2020,"&gt; That’s what makes me nervous for 2020... people will forget about what happened in 2016, decide Trump could never win a reelection

There are a few differences between 2020 and 2016. For starters, people don't hate Joe Biden as much as they hate Hillary Clinton. 

And 2020 has two significant issues that didn't exist in 2016: a pandemic that isn't even close to being contained, and an economic depression that's only going to get worse. Those two things are just propelling Joe Biden in the polls, even in red states in Texas and Alabama. This time in 2016, HRC was up 4 points, whereas Biden's currently up by 15 points. Never since presidential elections were being polled has a candidate had a consistent lead that is bigger than the margin of error. 

And if you noticed in interviews, Trump's sharp political instincts from 2016 are gone. In 2016 he hit HRC on corruption and trade deals, he managed to actually put himself to the left of her on those issues. Now? He's just making up lies about how Joe Biden wants to defund the police and him being a socialist. He's lost it so much that he was fact checked on Fox News. Joe Biden's staying mostly hidden from the public eye, Trump's losing to himself.

8/6/2020,"Anyone’s place on the political spectrum is, of course, relative. Biden will always look like a moderate when compared to a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders. Any Democratic nominee would be well to the left of a conservative Republican like President Trump. The same is true of Biden’s policy proposals. Few of his plans go far enough to satisfy the left wing of the Democratic Party. At the same time, his proposals on many issues are significantly more progressive than Barack Obama’s or Hillary Clinton’s.

Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote his criminal justice platform, which is going to let violent felons out of prison, which is going to eliminate the use of bail so violent felons are going to get out … of jail while they are pending their trial for violent crimes.

Beyond those “reforms” was the issue of gun control, which is something that Biden has promised to outsource to someone far from moderate.

I mean, look at what Joe Biden himself said on the campaign trail, that Beto O’Rourke is going to run his gun control policy, which is going to be gun confiscation.

He's also talked about giving amnesty to millions and millions of illegal immigrants and providing free Medicare for them as well.

1. I support bringing in entities that will get a grip on the “protests” taking place in Portland. I am 100% against those peacefully protesting (as that is what is stated in US constitution) being detained or subject to injury/punishment by these federal forces. Those looting, rioting and destroying public property deserve whatever consequences come because enough is enough now and it’s illegal. It’s one thing to protest, it’s another to riot. You have to at least somewhat follow a constitution or else you will have complete anarchy. 

2. Jesus Christ yes I can say that black lives matter... I don’t judge people like you do on people’s skin pigmentation... the fact of the matter is that people are black or white based on their ancestries distance from the equator... if you don’t realize that and you wanna be a racist POS who identifies someone based on the color of their skin, you’re a fool.  But I don’t support the BLM organization but those fighting for its purpose I 100% stand with. There’s no room for that shit. But the organization is a front for the DNC.

His base will eat it up. They won’t even notice that the benefits aren’t actually coming, and if they do they’ll blame Democrats because they’re clearly fighting against the EO.

Those like me only are supporting Joe Biden as a lesser evil, and with extreme prejudice. Every stupid action he takes from this point forward simply means that people like me will decide to sit out the election, giving Trump a higher chance of victory.

Having her be his Vice President would not likely be enough for me to sit out the election, but it would bring me very close to doing so. If he were to put someone more progressive as his Vice President on the other hand, who might legitimately make efforts towards policies I want Democrats to actually fight for, then I would be much happier. Policies like ending the war on drugs, improving healthcare/education, helping deal with poverty, etc.

I can only support Biden as a lesser evil as long as I think such policies might eventually get enacted as the Democratic party is dragged to the left by those like AOC and Sanders.

As for him “not accepting the results if he loses” (again, I will remind you that Dems won’t accept the results if they lose, either), whether he does or doesn’t, the constitution clearly says that he stops being President in January 20th, 2021, and Joe Biden would become President. So even if the President was being serious (which he wasn’t) we have a system in place that would prevent Trump from becoming a “dictator.” 

Why am I not worried? Why do I “not see why people are outraged?” Because I actually take a second to think through the issue. Even if Trump was a fascist and wanted to subvert our democracy (only in the Democrat imagination could wanting to prevent voter fraud be seen as “subverting democracy”), the authority of the Constitution is above him and democracy will go on without him.

Yup, Biden refused to give foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired Shokin, because Shokin was corrupt and refused to investigate and prosecute the Oligarchs that stole millions in US Foreign aid.  In addition to Biden demanding Shokin be fired, the president, the US State Department, the UK government and the EU government also made the same demands.  Coincidence?  I think not.  

&gt;	Biden’s son was on the oil company the prosecutor was investigating.

I can guarantee you have no idea what that investigation was about and how little it would have mattered to Hunter.  If Burisma had gone under it wouldn’t have impacted Hunters life in anyway.  Correlation doesn’t equal causation, and in this instance there’s absolutely no logical way to believe that Joe Biden wanted Shokin fired because of Burisma, and in an astonishingly coincidental happenstance the US, UK and EU governments also wanted Shokin fired for completely different reasons at the same time.

Trump is arguably one of the most pro-middle/lower class “politicians” in decades- and that’s why the establishment politicians/corporate media HATE him. Look what he just did with medical pricing. The Left wants us to think they’re “on our side” by doing meaningless shit like getting LIVE PD canceled, having an episode of Golden Girls removed from Hulu, &amp; changing computer coding terms, yet they do ZERO actual systemic reform. It’s all pandering nonsense that has no impact on anyone, besides making people’s lives harder. I mean, Kampala Harris kept 3 innocent men on death row, and withheld evidence that exonerated them until the public got ahold of it &amp; she was forced to let them go. Joe Biden assisted in drafting the 1994 tough on crime bill. Obama literally fucking drone striked a civilian hospital. They’re not evil because they’re democrats- they’re evil because they’re career politicians who have gotten rich off of being “public servants” by taking dark money, cozying to mega corporations,especially weapon manufacturers (like when Lockheed-Martin brought fucking BEYONCÉ to an Adam Schiff re-election campaign rally). DJT lacks serious tact sometimes &amp; puts his foot in his mouth, but I’d rather have a politician who says what he’s thinking with no thought, that way we know his worst thoughts/intentions; rather than a platitude spewing, virtue signaling, dementia-ridden, corporate groupie who will stick a knife in our back the first chance he/she gets. Oh, and who’s waiting for the slightest precedent to go to war with Iran,to appease his corporate, weapon dealing overlords.

7/27/2020,"First off, I have no feelings. Let’s make that known straight from the start. The law also has no feelings. 

I get the sense (still not a feeling) that you aren’t that knowledgeable about the law, and that’s understandable. Here are the facts from the video;

-There was not a weapon trained on truck guy at any point of the video. 

-it cannot be argued that truck guy was in fear for his life, because he parked and exited a vehicle which would provide him with a means of escape from a much slower pedestrian. Traffic was not impeded. 

-the truck guy aggressively approaches pedestrian guy and uses deadly force (any firing of a firearm to intimidate, scare, warn etc. is “use of deadly force” according to the laws of every state).  That is level 11 on a 1-10 scale all day long. TV, Movies and doddering old Uncle Joe Biden have lead your astray when it comes to “warning shots”.  You go to jail for warning shots. 

-pedestrian guys are idiots who are too dumb to skidaddle from mentally-unhinged guy who fired a gun at the road. 

-still not fearing for his life, but having used deadly force to try to scare Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber, truck guy gets back in the truck and drives off. 

-(as seen in the Ring video down the road, and heard on this video) truck guy squeezes off a few more indiscriminate rounds towards the colossal idiot pedestrians who decided to chase after the truck. 

Again, it literally does not matter what happened before the video because truck guy’s actions show that he was not in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. The video shows him as the aggressor. It shows him using deadly force multiple. 

Any good CCW instructor worth a damn always stresses that de-escalation and avoidance is the primary weapon that should be used. Truck guy used neither of those options available to him.  I would bet that he never had an instructor. 

There are plenty of justified self defense shooters to throw your support; this guy just isn’t one of them. Truck guy will make someone (probably an assigned PD) a horrible client and will be found guilty by any jury because judging by what we’ve seen, he’ll be to stupid to plead down.  

Look, nobody in this video is worth the time we’ve already spent on them.",-0.0756

Their approach of using *Joe Biden* of all fucking people as a Socialist Boogeyman is proving to be as idiotic as any partially politically aware person could've told them. So now they're in the process of making ads that, if I had to guess, will sound like actual policy, to air these few months before the election. They're retooling their platform (once again, in fucking AUGUST). 

Now all that remain to be seen is if the Tangerine-in-Chief is able to stick to the script of whatever the new platform is, or if (when) he'll go off on tangents and shoot himself in the foot again.",-0.0754
8/7/2020,"Script outline for an Honest Joe Biden ad:

Intro:
Trump really is an idiot, but he’s basically a neoliberal corporatist on all the major issues - his USMCA is just a reheated NAFTA/TPP deal, not that Republicans want to admit it.  His policies are designed to benefit billionaires like the Kochs (see the massive corporate tax cut, the massive corporate corona-bailout). His foreign policy (sloppy as it is) is basically a continuation of GW Bush and Obama-Biden policies, although nobody will believe him if he calls for a ‘humanitarian intervention’. Best described as a [blowhard](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/blowhard). Neoliberals consider him to be an embarrassment to the American Empire who is causing its international decline (see ‘global laughingstock’).

Body:
Joe Biden’s record is also that of a neoliberal corporatist, a warmonger, and a domestic authoritarian. We can see this from his record:
A) Was a backer of NAFTA, which destroyed Rust Belt manufacturing jobs. Also backed TPP under Obama.
B) Was a backer of the Clinton crime bill, targeted against poor minorities, which led to private prisons.
C) Was a backer of Glass-Steagall repeal, which led to the 2008 subprime fraud and collapse.
D) Was a backer of the bankruptcy bills which made it impossible for students to declare bankruptcy.
E) Was a backer of the Iraq war, the Libyan and Syrian debacles, Honduran coup, drone assassinations, etc.
F) Has been a lifetime servant of credit card companies, Wall Street, Delaware shell corporations, etc.

As far as his personal appeal, you probably would not want to leave him alone in a room with young women, he seems to have declining mental capabilities, he reacts to criticism the way a drunk in a bar would... But never mind all that.

Conclusion:
So, uh, gosh, vote for Biden, at least he’s not Trump! Yes We Can! Hope And Change!",-0.0753

8/5/2020,It totally is trivial. which is why from my perspective its like why would i give this nonsense the time of day. i guess i always just assumed people would see that it is a single weirdo and not an entire movement. Bc we all know which way it will be characterized by carlson or ingraham. Now if i vote for joe biden i hate kindergarden cop? o ok,-0.0743
8/4/2020,"After seeing his response to COVID and the Black Lives Matter movement and seeing how he blindly defends the police, I just don't think I can vote for him again. I honestly just ignored a lot of the stuff he did because it was easier than admitting that I'm a part of this massive fuck up. But I'm pregnant now and due next month and this isn't the world I want my daughter to grow up in. Now the more I look into his policies the more I realize I just don't agree with a lot of them. 

That being said, Joe Biden is also a piece of shit. Unfortunately my daughters first 4 years on this earth will also be at the same time a pedophile is president. My heart says vote third party but my brain knows that's basically useless

As a neoliberal with Larry fucking Summers pegged to get a job in his admin., it is likely that he'll do just as much for climate change as Trump did for his poor white fanbase (read: nothing). That said, he at least pays lip service and doesn't doubt its existence like the current retard in office. No issue matters as much as climate change. If we fuck it up and 100 years from now large swathes of the planet are unlivable, whatever your main political concern is today doesn't mean shit.

Trump is a complete asshole and is somewhat too big govt for me so I’m not sure yet. He was doing really well until the virus hit and he waited too long to execute a herd immunity plan like Sweden, but still refuses to lock down at least a little bit and wait for vaccines after we can’t do herd immunity anymore.

I don't think its a big deal for colin though, he isn't a political commentator so he doesn't really have an obligation to be accurate in how he views the world, though it is disappointing since i used to think he was a smart guy.

I said *the union that represents them* supports Biden (which is true) you illiterate fuck

&gt; We actually do it took five weeks.

The NYT wrote an article about this yesterday, I'd post if it the fucking automod would let me

It's taken six weeks and there's still two undecided races. 400,000 ballots and the worthless shits at the USPS can't handle it.

they mailed out 36k ballots ONE DAY before the election


&gt; Why is that an issue for you?

because it's bad for the country to go over an entire goddamned month without knowing who the president will be. and if it takes 6 weeks to count a few hundred thousand votes, it'll take months to count over 100 million. it won't be done by Jan. 20th

if you weren't as brain dead as Joe Biden you'd see the problem with that kind of uncertainty

&gt; we won't have 100 million voters

Not even remotely who he needs to cater to. He simply has to be not Trump.

As a result, at the first sign of a *Bivens* suit, those sycophants will turn tail and run or face financial ruin.

At the end of the day I’d rather have someone like Biden aim realistically high (which I think is the needle he’s trying to thread by rhetorically catering to the center and legislatively catering to the left) than have someone like Obama or Bernie promise the moon and deliver a rock.

He wrote the bill that repealed glass steagall and deregulated wallstreet and removed anti-trust laws.

He wrote the bankruptcy bill of 05 that barred students from filing for bankruptcy.

He wrote the Patriot act, the bill that gave the US gov the right to spy on US citizens, ie Ferguson protest spying, NYC Muslim surveillance etc. 

He and Barack Obama invaded 7 countries all on interventionist warfare against US coordinated and backed insurgency groups. In wars which we killed 90% civilians through drone warfare. FUCKING GENOCIDE AND CONTINUAL DEHUMANIZATION OF ARABS!  Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria. Libya has open slave markets because of US presence!

He and Barack Obama let the banks illegally foreclose on 6 million homes in 2009 during the subprime mortgage crisis. Refused to prosecute bankers, ZERO jailed.

Passed a half measure inferior ACA with a super majority after campaigning on single payer, Republicans were able to gut within a year.

He threatened to remove military aid to nation's who may have been harboring Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks who exposed US war crimes under Obama and Bush, targeting civilians, journalists and hospitals.

The conclusion to this is that Trump is not someone who just uses platitudes when he doesn’t mean them, when he dislikes someone or thinks they are a criminal he says so.

Trump worries about assassination by the far left and the DC establishment. He doesn't have much to worry about assassination by the religious right because he got traction that he was God's plan despite his ungodliness.

Pence is way worse for progressives, especially if Trump's base sees Trump dead. Pence would have a standing army and he would lead with an agenda against trans activists.

Pence is just meh for the DC establishment because of his religiosity. He's got no dirt to blackmail him on and a moral stubbornness that is hard to bend.

Trump is probably the most peaceful president since Carter.

Trump's economy has been extremely strong. You're economically illiterate if you don't understand tax cuts, particularly corporate ones.

Trump warned about a crisis and a need for finding at the border months before it became an issue. Democrats and the media claimed it was a lie for the 2018 election. Then it became an issue and the screeched about kids in cages.

Wall and enforcing the border are good things. They also keep coming because they know they can get in, i.e. they know someone else that has done it. It's a disease that grows exponentially, you can probably literally model it with the same equations. You have to nip in the bud. Democrats want to screech racism when border security is enforced, and then screech racism when a flood of people try to get in and we don't have the resources to deal with it thanks to a bill they killed. Then they find a couple of anecdotal cases where one of thousands die and try to paint the whole thing like Nazi concentration camps. This is pure evil.

There's no evidence George Floyd was killed die to racism. He also probably only died because he was coked up and had covid, which doesn't excuse the officer's behavior, but does mean it wasn't murder 2. They'll get that because of the case being high profile, and that's injustice. Those in the streets are fighting for injustice.

The media claimed anti-restriction protests are dangerous and almost treasonous. They claim George Floyd protests and far left nonsense are mostly peaceful and people are mostly wearing masks. OJ Simpson was mostly peaceful, like 9 out of 10 hours, when he killed his ex.

There are tons of vids of jackasses in Portland. Trying to burns down the courthouse, trying to cut the chain link fence. Media pretended this doesn't exist.

The treatment of Brett Kavanaugh was the worst thing I've ever seen. You mean....she doesn't know where it happened, when it happened, who drove her home, all the people at the party say they don't remember it including her lifelong friend..... And the accusation is that a drunk teenager got handsy with her 36 years ago?

And she's told multiple people about it over the years and at the time unlike Christine lying fuck face? And which does the media act like it's a fact?

I’m saying when you say openly explicitly say “the VP will be black” because it appears as if you aren’t giving a fair shake to other candidates who might be superior in the ways that count. 

I also think it cheapens the office and the black community because you are basically saying to them that the MAIN desire black people have is to simply see someone with the same skin color as them up there, which I do not believe is the case.

For example, do you believe that the black community for example would prefer Joe Biden as president or Herman Cain?

Because I believe merit and merit only should determine who political leaders are. I have no issue with every single politician in America being a “non-white”.

[Temporary reduction in daily global CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 forced confinement](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x)

The 17% drop off still isn't enough to satisfy climate experts wrt climate change patterns, even assuming it would be sustainable. This is, in large part, because we still have large volumes of carbon waste produced through electricity production. And it's summer.

We are, further, limited in both visibility and accessibility of low/no-carbon alternatives.

There was a meme yesterday about buying packaged fruit that was grown in Argentina, packaged in Thailand, and retailed in California. The sub openly mocked /r/anticonsumerism for highlighting this fact as a warning against purchasing packaged fruit.

What is the takeaway here? It feels like concervative-branded learned helplessness.

Don't try to be an informed consumer, because you'll get mocked for being anti-globalist.

Don't hold the carbon-wreckless manufacturers liable for carbon waste production, because everything is your fault (even after you've been living like a hermit for six months).

Also, do support a Carbon Tax and Nuclear Power, but only by Stanning Joe Biden. Any additional efforts are pointless.

BUT HER ICE CREAMS!!  Seriously, do you know how stupid you sound?  I give you numbers that show, FACTUALLY, that dems have raised taxes on the rich.  Your counter is that Nancy Pelosi has too much ice cream and something something she loves rich people.  Doesnt that sound stupid to you?  Did you know that ice cream sales are up nation wide, making Nancy more like the average person than not? If i have ice cream in my fridge, does that make me bad?  Just how far up this mountain of dumb argument are you willing to die on?  And again, Trump is literally playing golf at a stunning rate, but crickets from you on that.

And I'm not talking about payroll tax.  **Dems raised the income tax rate on the top bracket every time they took office in modern history.  Republicans lowered it every time in modern history.**  (but im the one who doesnt understand taxes...right).   Again, it's just math.  

But oh, you want to talk investment income?  Well i have news for you!  Republicans decreased the capital gains tax under President Bush.  Carter tried to tax it as regular income.  Obama let the Bush cuts expire in 2012.  Hillary ran on raising it.  Again, there's a clear MATHEMATICAL trend. I cant understand how you can be so conned by an old man as to not believe numbers.

It was so aww consuming that Twump had put Putin out of his mind compwetewy.

He had a new pway toy now.

He had been compwetewy absent fwom pwess confewences and his usuaw woutine Tweets wewe bawwen.

His advisows insisted that he needed to make a move ow peopwe wouwd begin to specuwate that he too was sick with Covid-19 -- but Twump just ignowed them.

“If you tawk to me again, I wiww fiwe you wike the west of them,” He said in one finaw, angwy text.

Instead of deawing with powitics, Twump was busy deawing with Biden’s body.

He had found in these past few days that this secwet affaiw was just what he needed to get thwough these wong, wabowious days.

He met Joe on Zoom dates, FaceTime and Snapchat.

But Twump wanted mowe.

One evening, as he sat in his bedwoom on a pwush tempuwpedic mattwess that had cost $10,000 dowwaws, he texted Biden those two gwowious wowds.

“cum ovew,” Twump impwowed.

He knew it wasn’t awwowed due to the pandemic - that it was going against the wawnings of evewy medicaw advisow and most of his cabinet. 

But he just couwdn’t wait.

He needed Biden now.

Pwus, science and medicine had nevew stopped him befowe so how couwd it stop him now -- now that he needed Biden’s body mowe than evew.

“i can’t,” Biden shot back within minutes, accompanied by a sensuaw pic of his aging gwoin, “cowonaviwus :(“

“uw going to wet that stop u???” Twump demanded, “when u couwd have this?”

His wotund owange tummy pwotwuded acwoss his phone camewa wike a wipe tangewine.

“give it to me, daddy,” He added fow effect - Biden wouwdn’t be abwe to deny him.

Not now, and not evew.

“fine,” Biden said, “u come hewe. 2 pewson meeting onwy.”

But that wasn’t enough fow Twump, who had an endwess suppwy of young wowking man’s bwood to sustain himsewf if he evew got sick.

He wouwd shawe with Biden... in exchange fow sex.

He was about to awgue as much, when his phone dinged a wong sensuaw ding again.

“jk….” Biden wwote, “i’m cumming 2 u”

Twump was spwawwed out acwoss his expensive bed when Biden cwimbed his wackety owd bones up the twee to get to his window.

In an unpwecedented move of genewosity, Twump had awwowed Demetwi, his head of staff, to owdew the west of the White House staff to shewtew in pwace in owdew fow Biden to access him without deawing with secuwity.

He couwd heaw the awthwitic cwack of Biden’s joints as he shimmied up the twee, cwawing towawds the window siww. 

Twump waziwy gazed at him, stwuggwing.

“Wowk fow me, you wazy democwat,” Twump muttewed sensuawwy.

Biden chuckwed. “I am an estabwishment dem,” he puwwed, “and thewefowe, we awe mowe powiticawwy simiwaw than you couwd evew imagine.”

“I know that,” Twump wowwed his eyes, “I just wanted to do a wowepway whewe you actuawwy give a shit about the wowking cwass and I can oppwess you with my giant MAGA cock.”

“I’ve seen youw cock,” Biden said, finawwy wetting himsewf in. He cwawwed acwoss Twump’s bed wike a spidew, “and it is not gweat by any measuwe.”

Twump shivewed. “But you can’t get enough of it.”

They wocked eyes.

Both powiticians knew the appeaw of the affaiw came fwom the secwecy and not fwom any attwaction to one anothew.

If they wewe actuawwy queew and gave a shit about gay wights, they might be swightwy coowew, but instead they wewe just getting off on being wich estabwishment GodWowd powiticians and had a wong voting histowy of homophobia and wacism to boot. 

“Pwetend you give a shit about the Amewican peopwe,” Twump cooed, “Fow me, Joe.”

Biden shook his head. “I can’t do that. I awweady do that on the campaign twaiw aww the time and it’s hawd, Don. Wet me just be an eviw megawomaniac wike you. It wowks bettew fow me on account of my dementia...”

That didn’t weawwy compute to Twump.

Sex to him had awways been about assewting his powew and weawth ovew the othew pewson and if they wewe equawwy powew-hungwy and wich, what was the point?

Stiww, Biden was hewe and he was howny.

Twump was in no pwace to awgue with his demands.

“Fuck me, daddy,” said Biden in a twuwy disgusting way. “I want to feew youw stimuwus package deep inside of me.”

I have called, begged, gone around, sought people who knew people who people all in hopes of making a contact, a call an idea. All have led to dead ends, refusals to talk to me, they wont even talk to my pain management dr when I asked her to call on my behalf. I did speak with the owner of a neuro shop here in town, He has about several dr.'s at this location and another southern location. some are neuros, some are Physiatrist. The neuro owner said he could not help me but would speak to one of his Physiatrist about taking me on to do botox shots.

that was about 4 weeks ago. When I got the emg on my arms being moderate to severe I sought out a neuromuscualr dr that also works at this owners shop. The woman that answers the phone told me I can not see the neuromuscular specialist since I am seeing another dr in the practice. I explained to her they do not do the same thing. She argued with me, they all do the same thing. I talked her into allowing me to leave a message with the assistant of the neuromuscualr's assistant. Never received a call back. 5 days later I receive a call from the owners assistant telling me the owner did me a favor with the botox dr. l explained how drastically things have changed. she was going to speak to the neuromuscular dr on my behalf. she nor he nor anyone has or will call me back.

Thanksgiving, 2019. pain mngt dr starts me on a new cocktail of drugs for the muscle wasting and nerve pain. 1st week no problem. Titrating up, take 2 meds at before bedtime. 2nd week, increase dose as specified. Had a horrible, life threatening reaction to the new meds. Into the ER I go. ER doc says I am just anxious and there is nothing wrong. I took my list of meds and doses with me in the ambulance, drs names, contact info, dosages,... you are just anxious. I explained it was a reaction to the meds. He discharges me.

Thanksgiving morning, now 7 am, earlier was about 1 am. 7 am thanksgiving morning back in the ER, Now there is a nurse practitioner. had the same list, explained the same things. she said I was an alcoholic. stop drinking. I told her i didn't drink with these meds. she said dont lie to me. Discharged.

Americans are suffering from unemployment but it’s not trumps fault just because he is the president, he may look like a dictator but he lacks the power of one thanks to the system of checks and balances. Trump did not make covid and personally spread it. Large protests and riots are just as responsible for the spread as businesses and churches who reopened early.

In point of fact, Antifa / BLM is the exact antithesis of what their name suggests – their actions prove that they are the true fascists. They violently oppose anyone with whom they disagree – often times to the point of deadly physical violence and death itself. They are responsible for the brutal killing and destruction of countless American lives – and in this particular case the majority of the lives and livelihoods they are destroying are those of Black Americans. Yet this is who the dems support – Joe Biden has donated money to bail them out of jail. Keith Ellison (the former Chairman of the DNC) has openly declared his support of Antifa, and his son just did so this past week. The mayor of Berkeley has proudly boasted about him being a card-carrying member of Antifa. Countless other dems, including each of the members of the “Squad” and even those who are less “extreme” also support and defend them.

Quickly afterward I realized he is a threat to the roots that hold us together. Rather than portraying the flag as the blanket that protects every single person in our country, ‘legal’ or ‘illegal,’ he made that flag represent one side. 
So I got three reasons.
1.) he is not a leader, he is a boss, he will fire anyone who doesn’t fit his end goal which is against our countries founding ideas of getting better at being the best every fucking day. 
2.) he drives a wedge into the already gaping divide of our country. He doesn’t take the podium and address the country he treats every presidential address as a personal rally and it’s sickening to see him push an entire half of the country away. 
3.) he’s a fucking dumbass like come on people, he can’t keep his temper under control, he spews out bullshit while being recorded then doubles down on a complete fallacy, he has no respect for other countries nor their leaders. He’s not the leading figure we want representing all of us.

8/9/2020,"&gt; “But if a man schemes and kills another man deliberately, take him away from my altar and put him to death.” In that very same verse.

No. In that very same chapter. You quoted Exodus 21:14, which is talking explicitly about murder. Exodus 21:22-25, the passages I quoted, are dealing with what happens when a pregnancy is terminated. Your argument is circular: first show that abortion is murder, then we can apply the Biblical law as it applies to murder.

&gt;I see you took a useless degree and now think you know more than the people that studied it for their whole lives, aka the priests and pope.

I claimed no such thing. The priests and the Pope deal with Catholicism. As I’ve said before: I do not judge whether Joe Biden is a good Catholic. What’s your background in studying religion or the Bible?

&gt;Did you know Biden has been denied communion for is his beliefs on abortion.

It doesn’t matter to me. Because that’s not my point.

As I’ve said before: You can’t argue that Joe Biden is a bad Christian for believing in abortion without reason. Your argument that the Bible says abortion is murder is false, because the Bible never explicitly states that. You may be able to twist a verse to be interpreted that way, but if it’s open to interpretation, then you can’t argue Joe Biden is a bad Christian because he may be interpreting that verse the other way.

If you want to argue that Joe Biden is a bad Catholic because he believes in abortion and the Pope says that’s wrong: I won’t argue with you. The Pope is the arbiter on Catholicism.

You, however, are not the arbiter on Christianity.

So, to repeat: Are you aware that other Christian denominations may have different views on abortion? Why do you believe your view is the only correct one? Are you an Evangelical Christian?",-0.0519

Now, I’m not an expert on grief or loss, nor do I get to dictate or decide what that means.

He and I would probably disagree on a lot, but I’m okay with that because I feel he understands the weight of his decisions. He knows what it is like to lose a loved one traumatically, he’s unfortunately had to experience it more than once.

So while he may not dismantle the Patriot Act as he should or go after heinous corporations, at least I can take comfort in the belief that at least those decisions are tempered with the value of a human life.

7/31/2020,"&gt;A state moving its primary (a primary which is only a small portion of a single parties’ national election) for a nominee is not at all the same as the federal government moving the date of a general election for elected office(s) representing the whole country.

&gt;No federal election date in the United States has ever been moved back. We’ve had elections during a civil war, World War 2, and a serious pandemic.

Yes, that's true. But it's somewhat anomalous among democracies. The UK didn't hold a parliamentary election for 10(!) years due to WWII, and it was fairly uncontroversial and didn't result in the UK failing into dictatorship. Not suggesting at all the US should do anything like that, but merely providing evidence that election delays are not the sole tactic of aspiring dictators.

&gt;The president just suggested moving back the only opportunity the American people have to remove him from power. He did this while slandering the safest method of voting during a pandemic based on no evidence, laying the groundwork for trying to claim the election was illegitimate to illegally stay in office. This was after months of the media saying that Joe Biden was insane for even thinking that the President would ever suggest we move back the election.

&gt;This is an unjustifiable, transparently authoritarian, malevolent act by an unfit president. If Trump was successful in moving back the election, I’m sure we’d be back here in a couple months for somebody to defend Trump’s call to cancel the election.

If there was news that Trump was going to try to use an executive order to unilaterally move the date of the election, then I would happily call that an authoritarian act. 

But here, it's a throwaway line at the end of the a tweet. Based on the other stuff he tweets, it's very likely he'll do nothing more about this at all. 

In the unlikely event that the election did get shifted, it would probably be no more than a month, need the support of Democrats to pass the House, and simply reduce the lame duck period.

None of this means I'm not worried about the chance that Trump will try to downplay the legitimacy of the election, should he lose by a small margin. I think that is quite likely, and his attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of mail-in ballots is a big part of that. That is what we should be worried about. \Delay the election???\"" is a silly distraction.""",-0.0489

Also, the argument of unemployment is completely void at this current moment. Unemployment is at 40%, yes, I know. But there’s also a pandemic. Ya know? The one that’s been keeping us locked up in our houses? Nothing that trump does is considered corrupt.

I want to see a president who believes in America, who proudly declares that while we are a flawed country with a flawed past like all others, that we are still a uniquely great country, dedicated to a future where all will fully enjoy their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Do I think Trump will do all that? HELL NO. He’s a politician, same as any other, he’s just open about the fact that he’s a slimy jackass.

But my alternative is the mostly dead former VP to O-bomb-their-weddings-a. The guy who was already in office and what happened? Taxes went up, our troops went out, civilians blew up, and nothing changed. For all the hope and change talk the Obama administration changed jack shit about the interventionist foreign policy.

Obama massively increased spending, raised taxes, and created an ineffectual half-socialized medical system that only exacerbated the problems caused by insurance companies.

7/26/2020,"The black lives matter movement and Democratic Party have killed and destroyed more black lives then police officers have in decades.

Joe Biden signed the crime reform bill that put thousands of black individuals in prison for life thereby increasing the amount of children without a father, which statistically shows they’re way more likely to end up in prison do drugs drop out ect.

Crime rates in various places have sky rocketed anywhere from 50-300% ( mostly densely populated areas) aka murder assault rape and burglary because robbing flatscreens is doing justice to George.

Hundreds of people have been killed since all this defund the police stuff

Black lives matter as a movement promotes and encourages violence and breeds entitled individuals. No one is saying black individuals lives don’t matter, everyone’s life does (of course there are exceptions I don’t feel like getting into hitler) 

Harvard did a study that proved police officers are actually more likely to shoot an un armed white individual

More police officers have been killed this past year than those killed by the police and of those people more whites were shot and killed then blacks 

Black individuals make up 13.4% of the population and are responsible for over 50% of crime. (U.S.)

All lives matter; black and white police officers matter, all children’s lives matter ( btw there were several mass shootings in Chicago so while the mayor was holding a briefing saying she won’t let trump come in and “ terrorize the citizens” there was * another* mass of 30 something people including several children dead, not in the name of trump or the Republican Party, in the name of BLM.)

Let's say u have someone who's a liberal. There are two possibilities with them: they either vote for Biden or write in someone else, probably Bernie. So there's one possibility where Biden gets +1 vote and one where he gets +0. No matter what Trump is +0. 

So writing in someone else makes joe Biden lose that +1 and considering the only two real possible winners and Biden and trump, that's half a vote for trump.
Now the reason I'm saying half and not one is because for most people, the two possibilities are trump or Biden. One possibility has trump +1 and Biden +0 and the other has Biden +1 and trump +0. The difference between these two possibilities is actually a value of 2. In the previous scenario the difference was a value of 1. 1 divided by 2 is a half so it's one half vote for trump if you don't vote for Biden AND u never had any intention of voting for trump.

The point is: Democrats have everything to gain from keeping black folks oppressed and angry.   They leverage that to their political advantage.   Look at Joe Biden.  Every single speech he gives is laden with racial undertones, attempting to leverage the current anger to gain political points.  That alone -- a privileged white man walking on the backs of dead black men and women -- is using this moment to curry political favor.

Instead of raising the price of them, they are basically going to become like machine guns and SBRs are where you have to register the gun and pay a couple hundred dollar tax, or you have to sell it back to the govt like in Australia, or you get to go in the slammer. However, the policy getting contested in courts does not make the person who made it a saint. Heck, I could pass a law that says kill all puppies, and it not passing, and I’d still be an uncircumcised cantaloupe of a human being. 

But no, Biden clearly hasn’t changed. Remember the “You ain’t Black” line? I could infer that Biden thinks that he is entitled to the Black vote from this line. Why? Probably because, like most Democrat leaders, Biden thinks that black people are incapable of thinking for themselves who are chained by welfare and handouts to the Democrat party. Biden thinks this now, Biden thought this when he said that poor kids were just as talented as white kids, Biden thought this when he said that Obama was the first articulate and intelligent black man, and he thought this when he signed the crime bill which was the result of people demonizing black people as monster rapists. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has kept blacks in some sort of slavery  for their entire existence. First slavery, then Jim Crow, then Mass Incarcaration, and now the welfare state. That is why Democratic leaders like Joe see black people as property and not people. 

Now, Trump’s quotes. 

The media warped and twisted these to paint a picture of Orange Man Bad. Here are the big ones 

- he said he “grabs women by the Pussy”. I mean, I guess, but they left out the part when he says “when they let me”. It made Trump look like a women-hater and a rapist. He’s not. 

-Trump said Mexicans are rapists. No, he said MS-13 Gang members coming over the border were. 

-Trump said Africans and South Americans were shitholes. No, he said some countries are shithole countries, and quite frankly, some are. That doesn’t make him racist.

7/26/2020,"&gt;They why are they claiming to be there to protect federal property? 

Because vandalism is a crime.

&gt;If they don't really suspect them, then why are they detaining them? That's just kinda proving my point that they aren't targeting instigators, they are randomly arresting people and hoping they can charge them with something.

I was wrong there. They aren't randomly arresting people. This is from the DHS secretary:

 I'm telling you what they're doing in terms of a process. And I fully expect that as long as people continue to be violent and to destroy property that we will attempt to identify those folks. We will pick them up in front of the courthouse. If we spot them elsewhere, we will pick them up elsewhere. And if we have a question about somebody's identity - like the first example I noted to you - after questioning determine it isn't someone of interest, then they get released. And that's standard law enforcement procedure, and it's going to continue as long as the violence continues.

So they're only arresting people suspected of a crime.

&gt;Dems have proposed bills targeting qualified immunity, choke-holds, and no-knock warrants. NYC is cutting funding to the police force. All we've gotten from the right is some bills banning choke-holds.

Ending qualified immunity does nothing good. And cutting police budgets isn't going to help either. 

&gt;They immediately passed another bill through the House that had everything his bill had and more and only 3 Republicans signed it.

Exactly. More. Dems didn't even get any GOP input, while with the GOP proposal, they wanted to debate with Dems over what to put in the bill. But they just shot it down. Republicans have said they want to work with Dems. But they refuse to. Trump already had created the federal data base for cops, created incentives for departments to send social workers and not cops, and incentives to  increase training.

&gt;What have they tried to sneak into their police reform bill?

They have said that they hope public pressure will force Republicans to just go with whatever bill they create on their own. It won't be long before they do what they did with the COVID bill.

8/8/2020,"It had been three days and Trump and Biden were still sexting on Snapchat.

It felt so wrong... but also so right.

It was so all consuming that Trump had put Putin out of his mind completely.

The Russian’s snaps had been left on read and Trump hardly noticed the bold text or smirking emoji next to it.

He had a new play toy now.

The American people were starting to wonder if the president was okay.

He had been completely absent from press conferences and his usual routine Tweets were barren.

His advisors insisted that he needed to make a move or people would begin to speculate that he too was sick with Covid-19 -- but Trump just ignored them.

“If you talk to me again, I will fire you like the rest of them,” He said in one final, angry text.

Instead of dealing with politics, Trump was busy dealing with Biden’s body.

He had found in these past few days that this secret affair was just what he needed to get through these long, laborious days.

He met Joe on Zoom dates, FaceTime and Snapchat.

But Trump wanted more.

One evening, as he sat in his bedroom on a plush tempurpedic mattress that had cost $10,000 dollars, he texted Biden those two glorious words.

“cum over,” Trump implored.

He knew it wasn’t allowed due to the pandemic - that it was going against the warnings of every medical advisor and most of his cabinet. 

But he just couldn’t wait.

He needed Biden now.

Plus, science and medicine had never stopped him before so how could it stop him now -- now that he needed Biden’s body more than ever.

“i can’t,” Biden shot back within minutes, accompanied by a sensual pic of his aging groin, “coronavirus :(“

“ur going to let that stop u???” Trump demanded, “when u could have this?”

His rotund orange tummy protruded across his phone camera like a ripe tangerine.

“give it to me, daddy,” He added for effect - Biden wouldn’t be able to deny him.

Not now, and not ever.

“fine,” Biden said, “u come here. 2 person meeting only.”

But that wasn’t enough for Trump, who had an endless supply of young working man’s blood to sustain himself if he ever got sick.

He would share with Biden... in exchange for sex.

He was about to argue as much, when his phone dinged a long sensual ding again.

“jk….” Biden wrote, “i’m cumming 2 u”

- - -

Trump was sprawled out across his expensive bed when Biden climbed his rackety old bones up the tree to get to his window.

In an unprecedented move of generosity, Trump had allowed Demetri, his head of staff, to order the rest of the White House staff to shelter in place in order for Biden to access him without dealing with security.

He could hear the arthritic crack of Biden’s joints as he shimmied up the tree, clawing towards the window sill. 

Trump lazily gazed at him, struggling.

“Work for me, you lazy democrat,” Trump muttered sensually.

Biden chuckled. “I am an establishment dem,” he purred, “and therefore, we are more politically similar than you could ever imagine.”

“I know that,” Trump rolled his eyes, “I just wanted to do a roleplay where you actually give a shit about the working class and I can oppress you with my giant MAGA cock.”

“I’ve seen your cock,” Biden said, finally letting himself in. He crawled across Trump’s bed like a spider, “and it is not great by any measure.”

Trump shivered. “But you can’t get enough of it.”

They locked eyes.

Both politicians knew the appeal of the affair came from the secrecy and not from any attraction to one another.

If they were actually queer and gave a shit about gay rights, they might be slightly cooler, but instead they were just getting off on being rich establishment GodLord politicians and had a long voting history of homophobia and racism to boot. 

“Pretend you give a shit about the American people,” Trump cooed, “For me, Joe.”

Biden shook his head. “I can’t do that. I already do that on the campaign trail all the time and it’s hard, Don. Let me just be an evil megalomaniac like you. It works better for me on account of my dementia...”

That didn’t really compute to Trump.

Sex to him had always been about asserting his power and wealth over the other person and if they were equally power-hungry and rich, what was the point?

Still, Biden was here and he was horny.

Trump was in no place to argue with his demands.

“Fuck me, daddy,” said Biden in a truly disgusting way. “I want to feel your stimulus package deep inside of me.”

They hopped on top of eachother and had sex in a truly unremarkable and unsatisfying way.

In that moment, they understood the pain the author was in when he wrote this, because neither of them prepped or used lube.

It was terrible just like this story.

We are cutting off our noses to spite our faces and accusing her of running a crappy campaign. Smh.

Republicans are keeping their eyes on the prize...Supreme Court and lower cuts that will gut gay rights (e.g. the recent adoption decision) while we criticize our candidates for hanging the moon incorrectly.

I must polish the turd (if that is what I see it as).

Hillary gave us early childhood education. She gave us CHIP (after her healthcare plan was rejected). From gay rights to voting rights...yes. I am a fanboy.

&gt;Why has the rest of the developed world pretty much beaten this virus while we have record breaking surges?

Well. On the one had you have leaders like Duterte and KJU who flat out execute anyone they even think is sick, on the other you have governments like Sweden that refused to shut down at all and encouraged their residents to spread the virus far and wide in hopes of generic herd immunity. Have they beaten the virus? Sure, but at the cost of every single human right we as Americans hold dear.

Even moderate examples like South Korea or Switzerland. They do not have foreign interference that thrives off their people being sick and dying. The U.S. does. 

&gt;Trump downplayed the severity of it for months, pushed states to reopen, refused to wear or call for wearing a mask, and now we see cases exploding while the rest of the developed world having flattened the curve

The alternative being what. Fearmongering? Relishing in people being out of a job and struggling to feed their children? 

I agree on the mask thing. But thats not his place. Masks are beneficial but government mandate shouldnt be the way to enforce it. Unfortunately media has mislead people so that now its the only way people will wear it. Even then, even with mask laws, people refuse to wear them.

And this is who the DEM “leadership” is defending – even to the point of suing to prevent these terrorists from being apprehended, despite the very clear grave danger they present to every citizen. Once again, the dems have proven themselves to be the party of criminals and lawlessness AS THEY SUPPORT BLATANT VIOLENCE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF LIVES, PERSONAL PROPERTY AND PREDOMINANTLY BLACK-OWNED INNER-CITY SMALL BUSINESSES AND A COMPLETE DEFUNDING AND DISMANTLING OF THE POLICE. Clearly BLM and Antifa are NOT peacefully protesting - rather they have been committing REAL terrorism and violence and are threatening to continue to do so, and as such have now been proven to truly be terrorists. These are the very same words and actions we have heard from terror groups such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hezbollah and Hamas. Anyone who still supports BLM and Antifa are no different.

THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMS SUPPORT (AND BIDEN EVEN BAILS THEM OUT OF JAIL!): BLATANT VIOLENCE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF LIVES, PERSONAL PROPERTY AND PREDOMINANTLY BLACK-OWNED INNER-CITY SMALL BUSINESSES (Don’t forget: this is the same Joe Biden who opposed desegregation and doesn’t believe that Black people have the ability nor the right to think for themselves, because apparently if you don’t vote for him (despite the fact that he advocates for the destruction of Black-owned businesses), then you “ain’t Black”). In point of fact, Antifa / BLM is the exact antithesis of what their name suggests – their actions prove that they are the true fascists. They violently oppose anyone with whom they disagree – often times to the point of deadly physical violence and death itself. They are responsible for the brutal killing and destruction of countless American lives – and in this particular case the majority of the lives and livelihoods they are destroying are those of Black Americans. Yet this is who the dems support – Joe Biden has donated money to bail them out of jail. Keith Ellison (the former Chairman of the DNC) has openly declared his support of Antifa, and his son just did so this past week. The mayor of Berkeley has proudly boasted about him being a card-carrying member of Antifa. Countless other dems, including each of the members of the “Squad” and even those who are less “extreme” also support and defend them. Not to mention the massive outpouring of liberals/regressives who have tweeted their support for Antifa since President Trump rightfully announced its designation as a terrorist regime.

8/10/2020,"Louis CK was accused at the very height of the #metoo movement and the “believe all women” phase.  He didn’t stand a chance. 

Alyssa Milano, who championed the “believe all women” movement, “explained what the term *actually* meant” (that is: due process and evidence apparently *does* matter), 2 whole years into it **as soon as** her boy Joe Biden was accused by multiple women.

People crave power, and the #metoo movement gave women the ability to destroy men of lofty positions and, to no one’s surprise, it was wildly abused.  

Take the “allegations” against Neil deGrasse Tyson, for instance.  A couple women perceived some past actions of his as being creepy. Fine, whatever.  He had literally apologized behind closed doors to one of the women. 

But that wasn’t good enough for them. They decided it’d be a great idea to turn it into a giant news story that rapidly spread online across the whole planet, all because he had once made them feel *uncomfortable.*  It was just a wildly disproportionate reaction to what they perceived as him overstepping a boundary.

Who did this ultimately hurt?  Women trying to advance in the world of business, science, entertainment, etc.  After seeing all of this crap, you can guarantee that male CEOs and celebrities around the globe will interact with women as little as possible or, at the very least, *never* be alone in a room with a woman without security cameras rolling.

Arrogant Reddit posts won’t convince anyone of anything, I’m actually surprised you believe Biden is / would be.. making any policy decisions. His cognitive functions have deteriorated severely since 2012 when he was last in the campaigning spotlight and sadly he is getting worse week by week. I know you ignore the obvious signs already or you wouldn’t admit to supporting him however it’s unlikely he will be able to even participate in presidential debates. I can already imagine the excuses the DNC will provide but his mind is slipping rapidly and I can’t help but wonder why the DNC establishment decided to prop him up as a candidate other than the hopes his name and face recognition would open the door for the socialist wing that has taken over the DNC can push the radical policies and use him to soften the messaging and make it a bit more palatable for the public..

 * Eliminated Pell Grants for prisoners.
 * Directly funded the new hire of 10,000 police officers.

Obama opposed an independent Kurdish state and so does the EU.

Autonomy? Under which Syrian government? Assad is still to this day in opposition to any political changes, only an absolute submission.

So clearly Biden needs to deal with Syrian Arab rebels, who are currently trying to just survive under Turkish protection. Not only is Turkey hostile towards YPG, PKK and SDF, but Syrian Arab rebels themselves still to this day feel completely betrayed by YPG. Not only did YPG refused to join up with them to tack down Assad, but during siege of Aleppo in 2016 they sided with the regime to remove rebels out of the city. When A'zaz rebel pocket was trying to survive ISIS onslaught and to do any offensive operation against ISIS, YPG in Efrin kept attacking them from the opposite front. The worst was even when after Kobane was liberated from ISIS, despite local Syrian Rebel forces aiding YPG against ISIS, YPG turned on them and deported their forces and families out of the region.

There was an [interview back in May](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-joe-biden-foreign-policy-adviser-antony-blinken-on-covid-shortfalls-failures-in-syria/) where Biden's foreign policy adviser admits Obama's admin failed in Syria and current plans are for rebels to keep Idlib and Assad is denied of oil currently in hands of YPG.

Basically Biden will have to work with Syrian Arab rebels and Turkey to end hostilities and form some political solution between them all. And this also includes to somehow topple down Assad's regime, who is protected by both Russia and Iran.

Oh yeah that circles back to Iran Nuclear Deal. Which is a whole another story. There are good reasons why people were upset at Obama's Iran Nuclear Deal, but obviously Trump made things much worse.

Shokin went on in the declaration to say that “the illicit influence of Joseph Biden” was evidence of “interfering in the activities of a law enforcement officer.”

Furthermore, arguing that anyone who supported Bernie in a primary election, will then go on to support his opponent for the sole reason that they ran in the same party is a flawed and dangerous strategy.

There are reasons, like the allegations of sexual misconduct, which people will cite as reasons they wouldn’t vote for Biden, that have nothing to do with whether or not Bernie supports Biden.

The truth is that Joe Biden, is a terrible candidate.

There are many tangible, glaring issues with him as a politician.
He is not the best choice in such a dire situation.

The Democratic party is morally bankrupt, they are conspiring with the obnoxiously wealthy corporate scumbags to refuse to legalize marijuana and release nonviolent drug offenders, which we know for a fact disproportionately affects black human beings and other racial “minorities” which is just a word used to differentiate them from white human beings.

The Democratic Party is refusing to publicly support Medicare for All, in the middle of the worst global pandemic and economic crisis we have ever faced.

I’m not talking about the Republican party, but if I was, I’d be talking about the sinister, complete lack of empathy that those in power in the GOP have for human life.

We are being fucked by both sides.
This is a reality that if you refuse to acknowledge, you won’t be taken seriously by voters.

Don’t make excuses for Biden, tell it like it is.

She said she filed an official complaint, Biden says to bring forward that complaint, she said the next day that the complaint doesn't include rape or sexual assault.  


She worked closely with him and for him, and endorsed him, for decades after the assault. Not really something some one who was violated would do.

I can't find any evidence of this particular assault happening, and if it did and there was credible evidence behind this Fox News would be running it non-stop cause it would help suppress democratic vote and help trump win. They haven't said a word on this even as trump is crashing hard and they are desperate to do damage control. Because something like a valid rape charge would definitely cause democrats to not support Biden and suppress the vote.

8/10/2020,"Every day I think about how much I would like to hear someone as articulate as Buttigieg leading the opposition, operating from the  JFK/Clinton/Obama playbook of passion capability and optimism. 
Or to have someone as clearly defined as Sanders whose politics are his values and would make this campaign collective and national education of what things could be like if we put people first. 

Instead of either of those we have Biden, so our message is remember how well the 8 years went under the Obama/Biden administration. Not the worst strategy, if Al Gore ran that campaign shoulder by shoulder with Bill he would have won before a recount. Instead he tried to define himself apart, back when impeachment just another word on the nightly news.  

Joe’s advantage is that we call him Joe. We know him, he is familiar, and it’s not Joseph it’s Joe. Friendly. Known quantity and well liked, will make Trump’s dirty tricks more difficult. America worships celebrity, people forgave trump for all his shady grimy and crimey bullshit bc it fit within our expectations. Love him or hate him, I don’t think anyone was truly shocked he paid a pornstar to keep quiet, not unexpected. Not like Jon Edwards was unexpected. 

Joe has benefited from taht familiarity too, bc he has said some dumb dumb things. Both early in his career and very recently.

All you hear about are his tweets and him doing stupid shit. Like if that don’t seem bias to me idk what is. Not even a republican, but goddamn the left has never looked so bad. Your party is taking advantage of the black lives of this nation and using the money it has raised to support Joe Biden and Bernie sanders campaign. Joe Biden literally said that he didn’t want his kids to grow up in a racial jungle when talking about desegregation in the 70s. Rosa parks and Donald trump were actually photographed together during an award ceremony for helping inner city black youth. The fact that y’all are removing all POC from brands and sports teams is not helpful or productive in anyway. You are destroying their influence in America and oppressing them further. I didn’t realize that only white people on brands was allowed. How does that not seem racist. There was a pole taken amongst Native Americans saying that 90% of them don’t think it’s racist in anyway and it’s a part of their culture that was represented in sports or butter. Like y’all literally removed the Native American on a butter product and kept just the land. How is that not ironic.

I don’t think the electoral college works as intended now political parties are so powerful I think that is to the detriment of the average voter especially considering the US president can veto legislation etc. A choice between having Biden as president or Trump as president isn’t one I’d want to have to make because they’re both bad choices and (as not an American) not one I would want to make. Although I think I’d choose not-Trump as he seems to be more dictator-lite than I think anyone else would get enough support to be.

No one thought he was racist until he beat Hilary. Now he's got small hands, he's a racist and he's a misogynist. He's remarkably capable, he won the 2016 election against the odds after getting mainly negative press coverage. After Obama told us that all these jobs aren't coming back he responded with the lowest unemployment in history, especially black unemployment, and the highest DOW value in history. 

He negotiated a new trade deal with China, that means a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of goods imported from China and later imposed an additional 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods. He negotiated a better deal from NATO, and managed to bring a lot of our troops home. 

Everything that he does he does for the good of America. He's a patriot, and he's an American Hero, that's why I'll vote for him.

The only hope he has in November is if the combination of fear, distrust, and dislike for Joe Biden is stronger than for him.

The odds of that are low.

Although I do think on Covid-19, they scratched the surface of why it's so tough to measure these things. He's got charts on deaths as a function of confirmed cases. The other guy wants to look at deaths as function of total population. It's no surprise that one reflects very favorably on Trump and the other reflects very unfavorably on Trump. I believe the truth is somewhere in the middle, but this segment really highlights our disconnect when discussing the virus. And this disconnect bleeds over to other topics; racism comes to mind. How Trump and Swan dealt with this disconnect is disappointing, because both just kept insisting we use their measurement and they never really talked about the implications of either and why one should be used at the expense of the other.",-0.0321

The man is from the age of 'kissing babies' and now you want to characterise that as 'he wants to fuck babies. But you look at Trumps Daddy/Daughter photo shoots and that was creepy as fuck even at the time.

As for 'racist' Joe , yeah no ones buying that shit either. A policy from 25 years ago is semi relevant, but only if you keep it in context of Trump 25 years ago calling for the death penalty on black guys found innocent, on Trumps racist real estate practices and Trumps family history.

But today's racism check card is all the racist shit Trumps said, all the racist shit trumps done, vs Biden arguing with a black dude who was talking up Trump.

But I'll take the view that the real racism experts, like Stormfront, like the KKK, David Duke, and the Proud Boys, and the Confederate flag fuckers all Think Trumps just peachy fucking keen.

I explained to him how kids would spread it out of control, and it was a bad idea)

His response was along the lines of “they’re saying Kids can’t spread it anyway.” I explained to him kids most definitely can spread it, and they whatever he was reading was bs. But he just countered with “kids get sick sometimes, they need to go to school!”

He then went on to call the Teachers wussies because he goes to work everyday while they’re refusing. I asked him if everyone at his work
wears a mask and keeps distance. He confirmed they did. So then I asked him how teachers are going to ensure 30+ kids keep masks on and social distance.

The Democrats should always be looking to improve themselves and they won’t if the people don’t actually push them to do it. 

Trump didn’t get here by himself. His presidency is the culmination of a variety of factors over decades including Democrats’ embrace of neoliberalism and their inability to materially support voters who’d eventually turn to Trump. These blue collar voters decided both parties didn’t care much about their healthcare, education, factory jobs, pensions, relatives in Iraq and Afghanistan etc...and it’s tough to really blame them (you say Clinton was unfairly attacked for her emails but many people already had good reason to dislike the Clintons, which makes their decision to run her as the nominee, and now an aging establishment Joe Biden, a pretty big head-scratcher). These voters had nothing else to cling to other than their Christian faith and fear (of immigrants, of minorities, of crime, of abortions/gay people and other social issues), and instead of helping them materially through populist policies, attacked them for their socially backward views and lack of political correctness. You understand why some would feel angry about these moral attacks when the DNC has done fairly little to really help these people in recent decades. It’s not that these people are justified in their hate and bigotry, but you can’t ignore the cause of this social unrest.

It’s just sad that people like you continue to use the “Trump/Russia have infiltrated the left” excuse for why Hillary lost and why Biden has little genuine support. Of course the Trump campaign/Russia will do whatever they can to discredit and attack Hillary/Biden including amplifying genuine concerns from the left, but there’s absolutely no way this is what caused her to lose. Hillary lost because she was HILLARY CLINTON and no matter how accurate some of the accusations about her are, she’s a cold and calculating person with a controversial history who flip flops all the time on issues and has flip flopped her entire political “stance” already. People just didn’t want to vote for her, they were tired of her. Also she ignored the Midwest leading up to the election.

I 22m and my gf 27f live together. She has been isnisting we sleep with a nightlight on and I told her sure whatever as I thought it was a joke and low and behold she actually pulls out a nightlight. 

At first it was cool cuz sex is always better when its dark, but the nightlight made it better cuz at least there was some visibality. I still thought this was a joke until the 4th day I got sick of the nightlight and I turned it off. She wakes up probably and hour later and is freaking out nad she's pissed at me. This is when I learn she's still afraid of hte dark, at 27 years old, like what the fuck. Look i love my girlfriend and my girlfriend is one of those people who's really smart in some ways and really fucking stupid in other ways. Like she couldn't point hte US on a map and she thought Joe Biden was the current Vice President, but she also took multivariable calculus at 16 and builds robots now. This is one of those ways where she's really stupid, she's still afraid of the dark and she thinks something will come hurt her if the lights aren't on. 

I've told my girlfriend she needs to grow up, and that there are no monsters hiding in the closet or underneath the bed and if they were, a nightlight isn't going to stop them. I also always sleep with a loaded colt 1911 underneath the pillow and with a M1 Carbine underneath the bed. We are completely safe from any intruders. 

She says im being an asshole for not sleeping with the nightlight but fuck, i can't sleep with it on and she should've outgrown a nightlight like 17 years ago.

They are a garbage radical neo-feudalistic party that is so blatantly sponsored by the shittiest corporations/organizations in the world that I believe they are a threat to furthering democracy itself.

3. **Don't be afraid to be boring.** The public is tired of Trump's act. They want competence to replace the reality show. Stick to your own game. Always be the adult in the race.
4. **Don't take the bait.** Trump will goad you with ridiculous and slanderous charges on a daily basis. Use your advertising resources to respond where necessary to Trump, keep your message about what's best for the American people.
5. **Whatever you do, don't debate Trump.** Trump has now made more than 20,000 misleading or false statements according to [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/13/president-trump-has-made-more-than-20000-false-or-misleading-claims/).

One thing you're on to is that cops will use basic human judgement to threat assess. If they see someone who is larger, they would be more of a threat in the event that the encounter turns worse. If they see a 20 year old black man, they're more likely to judge him as a threat then an 80 year old Japanese women. Whether that is morally right or not is also up for discussion, but that's just human to judge based off of what's shown.

Anyone who refuses to watch it is simply choosing to ignore the truth, as there is no other excuse. Clearly BLM and Antifa are NOT peacefully protesting - rather they have been committing REAL terrorism and violence and are threatening to continue to do so, and as such have now been proven to truly be terrorists. These are the very same words and actions we have heard from terror groups such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hezbollah and Hamas. Anyone who still supports BLM and Antifa are no different.

In point of fact, Antifa / BLM is the exact antithesis of what their name suggests – their actions prove that they are the true fascists. They violently oppose anyone with whom they disagree – often times to the point of deadly physical violence and death itself. They are responsible for the brutal killing and destruction of countless American lives – and in this particular case the majority of the lives and livelihoods they are destroying are those of Black Americans. Yet this is who the dems support – Joe Biden has donated money to bail them out of jail. Keith Ellison (the former Chairman of the DNC) has openly declared his support of Antifa, and his son just did so this past week. The mayor of Berkeley has proudly boasted about him being a card-carrying member of Antifa. Countless other dems, including each of the members of the “Squad” and even those who are less “extreme” also support and defend them. Not to mention the massive outpouring of liberals/regressives who have tweeted their support for Antifa since President Trump rightfully announced its designation as a terrorist regime.

Evanina also warned that pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach , the son of a former KGB officer, “is spreading claims about corruption — including through publicizing leaked phone calls — to undermine ...

7/30/2020,"Here's a rundown by journalists at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. There might be a paywall, hence why I copied it

&gt;With November fast approaching, here’s a recurring question that can’t easily be dismissed as alarmist fretting or grim humor: What if President Donald Trump loses his bid for re-election but refuses to concede and instead clings to power? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed this concern last year, saying “we have to inoculate against that.” So did Trump’s prison-bound former lawyer Michael Cohen. Testifying before Congress, Cohen said, “I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.” Even Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic rival, doesn’t discount the possibility that Trump would make himself difficult to dislodge, but he suggested that others in government would get the job done: “I promise you, I’m absolutely convinced that they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.”

If Trump does try to hang on to a presidency he’s lost, however, he can’t actually do very much all by himself. Running the executive branch requires help. Thankfully, there are laws that stop others from using the authorities of the executive branch on behalf of anyone other than the legitimate president. If William Barr, for example, tried to exercise the powers of the attorney general after a Trump loss, he could be subject to criminal prosecution.

The circumstances matter. If Trump legitimately wins on Election Day, he wins — so be it. And if he loses, well, American tradition calls for a peaceful transfer of power to one’s successor. But given Trump’s rampant tradition-busting, there’s more than a little reason to worry that he’ll continue to reassert baseless claims that there was election fraud via mail-in ballots or foreign election interference favoring the Democrats, even after he has failed to persuade lawfully constituted authorities of such fantasies. Whatever Trump’s excuse, it would require little imagination to suppose that he would claim some need to retain power at least long enough to investigate whatever election irregularity he’s claiming, such that, come Jan. 20, 2021, he and Biden would be advancing competing claims to be America’s legitimate president.

But while there’s a reasonable fear that Trump could take such an appalling and dangerous step, any such effort would have a serious vulnerability. A president cannot run the executive branch alone. We’d like to think that, even if Trump himself refuses to face the music, officials throughout his administration would not follow his lead. And if they were to waver in their commitment to our constitutionally prescribed methods for transferring power, we’d hope they’d be encouraged to do the right thing by virtue of the fact that there are federal statutes that make it unlawful for others to exercise executive branch authorities on behalf of someone who’s not actually the president.

For example, it’s a crime to pretend to be an officer or employee of the United States when one isn’t. A federal statute reads: “Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.”

Note that the first offense defined by the law involves simply falsely assuming or pretending to be a U.S. officer or employee — there’s no demand for money required. So, imagine an outgoing Cabinet member, such as a secretary of defense or homeland security, who’s been fired by a legitimate president immediately upon being sworn in on Jan. 20. That outgoing Cabinet member would violate this criminal prohibition if he or she were still to purport to exercise executive branch authority; for example, if the ex-secretary of defense ordered a military operation or ex-homeland security secretary issued an immigration edict, powers that no longer belong to officials ousted from the executive branch.

This would be an extraordinarily risky thing for any outgoing Cabinet official to do — even if they believed the certified election results were wrong. If the outgoing attorney general agreed with the fired Cabinet official, that attorney general would have legitimate authority over federal criminal prosecution only until Jan. 20. After that date, any attempts by the outgoing Cabinet member to exercise official authority would risk criminal prosecution and sentencing by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia appointed by President Biden with the new Senate’s advice and consent — or by an interim U.S. attorney appointed by Biden before the new Senate could give its consent. Who’d take such a risk?

There are also laws specific to the military that demand obedience to the one and only legitimate president. Under one provision, a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff executing an order given by someone who’s not the lawful president could be deemed to have “fail[ed] to do his utmost to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition being committed in his presence.” That same provision criminalizes even attempting mutiny or sedition. Moreover, another statutory provision criminalizes soliciting or advising the commission of mutiny or sedition.

So, imagine a senior military commander asking those under his or her command to execute an order given by an ousted President Trump: That act could well carry the risk of prosecution for the senior military commander as an attempt at mutiny or sedition. And federal law not only criminalizes certain acts when done on behalf of someone other than the actual president but also criminalizes certain failures to act when so ordered by the lawful president. So, a uniformed service member who disobeys an order from a superior commissioned officer given to him through the proper chain of command — ultimately responsible to the actual president — would also risk criminal prosecution through the military justice system.

Additional laws punish the exercise of other specific executive branch authorities if used for illegitimate purposes, such as in support of someone not actually the legitimate head of the executive branch. For example, there are criminal penalties for intentionally engaging in electronic surveillance under color of law except as actually authorized by federal law. It’s thus a crime for someone employed by, say, the National Security Agency or the Federal Bureau of Investigation to engage in electronic surveillance under the pretense of governmental authority without in fact having such authority — and someone claiming to order that surveillance as or on behalf of an illegitimate president would lack the necessary authority.

As we confront a potentially fraught presidential transition ahead, the time to make use of these laws is now. Key Cabinet members affected by them and related statutes — such as Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, Attorney General Barr, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf — will very likely testify before Congress at some point in coming months.

That’s an opportunity: A chance, with these Cabinet officials under oath, to ask them whether they are aware of these laws, understand their meaning and significance and intend to abide by them if Trump is determined to have lost the presidency in the Nov. 3 election. Nothing can, with total certainty, ensure a normal transition of power from as abnormal a president as Donald Trump. But it’s vital to recognize that, if Trump tries to retain power illegitimately, he’ll need help from his Cabinet. Members of that Cabinet should go on the record pledging their ultimate adherence not to Trump but to the Constitution and laws of the United States.",-0.0280

Also our “progressive” candidate was part of the administration that starting the strategy of putting kids in cages. Not to mention he was also part of an administration that deported more people than Trump.

Thomas is ultra conservative and Joe Biden dragged Anita Hill’s name through the mud all to support the nomination of a conservative Supreme Court judge.

And our “progressive” candidate during the Obama administration supported the massive (and illegal) wire tapping and surveillance of American citizens. And Biden still thinks Edward Snowden should be in jail for revealing the crime the US government was committing against the people.

Only because Bernie Sanders isn’t President. 

&gt;	I don’t think you have any idea what “neoliberal” even means. Every argument I’ve made here has been against the dominant neoliberal paradigm, not for it.

Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders. They all have the same immigration policies. 

By arguing to allow in migrant labor you’re only perpetuating the neoliberal paradigm. How do you think neoliberals are hurt by cheaper labor? 

&gt;	And the government does little to stop these people from exploiting migrants.

There shouldn’t be any migrants to exploit. 

&gt;	That’s quite a claim there - gonna need actual evidence.

There’s almost no way to track this directly. Look at cities with the highest homeless populations: San Fransisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York City. 

What else do these cities all have in common? 
Seattle minimum wage: $15.45, New York and San Fransisco: $15, LA and San Diego: $13.

US average is $11. 

What else? San Fran, LA, : 35% immigrant population. New York: 40%. Seattle: 28%, San Diego: 25%.

US average is 14%. 

Just things to consider. 

&gt;	This is such a hair-splitting difference that I’m tempted to say you probably don’t know what those words mean very well either.
&gt;
&gt;	The only difference between these terms is that citizenship can be changed, and even then there are a lot of definitions that don’t make that distinction.

The words ‘Nation’ and ‘Ethnicity’ are both derived from the Greek word ‘Ethnos’, literally translated to “nation” or “race”.

The American nation is a White, European one. It’s not Mexican, it’s not Central American. 

&gt;	And the effect of the distinction that you’re making is that even people from other countries who legally come and become naturalized citizens are still inferior in your opinion

Not inferior, different. You can legally move to Namibia, doesn’t make you African. 

&gt;	Except when they literally are, with the threat of death pushing them

If the nature of being alive in those countries means the threat of death, how are there still tens of millions of people in those countries? 

Almost 200 million in Mexico? 

&gt;	Using this argument, I could say that the homeless American did something wrong too. S/he became homeless.

So an American did something wrong, and a Mexican did something wrong. Your belief is that the American comes second to the Mexican, even in America. Can you explain this thought process? 

&gt;	And the poor person’s parents are to blame for having a child themselves.

Only if the parents were homeless when they conceived and had the child. 

Your argument to this point has essentially been that the American regime has made it a death sentence to be alive in Mexico or Guatemala (which we both know to be false), and therefore they had no right to bring a child into that world. The same way homeless people do not have the right to subject a child to a life of homelessness. 

&gt;	This doesn’t mean anything. It just sounds good as a method of pretending the US has never caused other countries to become impoverished so we can refuse to take responsibility or exhibit basic humanity.

You keep saying this and it makes no sense. How can you continue to say the life of an American is worth less to the American government because it needs to be punished for things it did to Guatemalans? 

The scenario is we have a poor American man, and a poor Guatemalan man. Both of whom are competing for any job they can find in order to put food on the table.

My argument is the American man should find work in America, the Guatemalan man should find work in Guatemala. If Guatemala’s government is unwilling to care for its people, he should remove the government. If he is unwilling, he should find work in a country that is made up of the same people, the same folk. There are 7 countries in Central America, not including Mexico. The official language in Guatemala is the same has in all 8 of those countries. The ethnic origins of all 8 of those countries are nearly identical. 

It is not the same language as America. It is not the same ethnic background of America. 

The same goes for the American man. Find an American job. If the American government won’t protect American’s from foreigners taking the jobs, his duty is to remove the government. No one would ever suggest the American man move to Guatemala to take the jobs. 

So far as I can tell, your argument is that the Guatemalan man has priority over the American man, because of perceived atrocities committed by the American government against the Guatemalan people. 

If this isn’t your argument, please explain why you continue to bring up injuries the Americans have caused the Guatemalans.

&gt;	Even though that’s not what I’m doing, it’s a funny accusation coming from the person openly defending the hundreds of millions of lives the United States has ruined

See above

&gt;	I never said you’re defending it per se, but you’re certainly saying we should do nothing more to help the hundreds of millions of people in the countries we’ve fucked up. So in a way, it is defending it.

See above again. Have you ever heard the story of the wasps and the bees and the flies? You’re acting a lot like a wasp right now.

&gt;	Yes, because it is the war on drugs itself that makes these cartels profitable and violent

So in your mind if drugs were illegal, and no one used drugs, cartels are powerful.

If drugs are legal and everyone buys cartel drugs, cartels disappear? 

Can you explain this logic? 

Of course you can’t, because we both know drug use is what keeps cartels in power. If they have no product to sell, or no consumers to buy, they lose everything. 

&gt;	So you are defending the policies that caused the immigration you hate so much.

Not in the slightest. 

For example Ohio has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country. There were 20,000 abortions in Ohio in 2017. Maryland has unrestricted access to abortion, and had 37,000 abortions in 2017. 

Maryland has half the population of Ohio. 

So clearly making things illegal decreases the amount of that thing. 

We see the same effect with drugs. The number of people who use pot does not decrease because pot is legalized. 

&gt;	I could tell you’re not a republican when you started making arguments in favor of poor people rather than calling them lazy slobs.

I bet we actually align on a lot of “left wing” issues. I care about poor people, I care about animals, I care about the environment. I care about families, I care about healthcare, I care about education, I care about my people. Except I’m a fascist. So, ironically, we agree on a ton of policies but you think I’m as far right wing as you can go, and odds are you want to see me dead. 

Just goes to show how little discussion can actually be had. 

&gt;	Ah, so we’re resorting to outright lies. Good to know.

Where have I once suggested attacking migrants? I’ve said multiple times I just don’t think there should be any migrants here at all, from any country anywhere. I don’t care who they are, what they look like, what their education level is, none of it matters. America is for Americans. Latin America is for Latin Americans, Asia for Asians, Europe for Europeans, etc. 

I don’t want Guatemalans here, I don’t want Nigerians here, I don’t want Germans here. They all have their own countries. Just because mine is better doesn’t mean they get to come and take it, especially not when we have 40 million people who are in poverty who need help just as much. 

&gt;	There are solutions to the problems of American poverty that don’t include punishing the millions of refugees that our country’s policies have created.

This might be true, but find me a single solution to American poverty that include punishing the millions of impoverished people who already live here, and explain how it benefits the impoverished Americans to have impoverished Mexicans brought into our country. 

The truth is, you can’t have it both ways. You can’t help poor Americans and poor Guatemalans at the same time, so why choose the foreigner?",-0.0249

Edit: I agree with all of you that people that believe in Pizzagate are crazy and that pictures of Trump and Epstein exist, while no pictures of Epstein and Biden have surfaced. The problem is that misinformation and fake news propagated by social media and right wing media is very convincing to the uninformed.

[Fox news edited Trump out of a picture with Epstein and Maxwell](https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-says-mistakenly-edited-trump-out-epstein-maxwell-photo-2020-7). That was a huge news story, but I would bet that some in the right wing echo chamber never heard about it.

Hah, please learn what a bad faith argument actually is, it's not just an argument you don't like. And it's hardly a 'false equivilance'. I just proved that the DNC do as much imperialist bs as the RNC. Please read a history book sometime. The only one spreading right wing lies here is you. Liberals are right-wingers in denial. Only Communists and Anarchists are truly left wing.

Though ultimately I'm guessing your 14 since you think 'bad at memeing' is an insult. You'll grow up and learn in time.

There's no substance to acknowledge. How am I arguing in bad faith? Quite frankly you've made no arguments yourself for me to argue against. I presented you with evidence you called them 'right wing' lies despite the fact that I condemned the right wing as well.

Substance involves you making some actual arguments. You've made none. You lost with my first comment and you've spent a whole day trying to moralise the situation and recover from your stupidity.

No 'both sides' aren't the same. Democrats and Republicans are on the same side. The reactionary right. I stand on the left. I'm a Communist. They're nothing like me.

Yes this meme is a repost, we have established that. I say again: So? Why does that matter?

I have made no false equivalence. Democrats and Republicans both bomb hospitals. Joe Biden and Donald Trump have both partaken in policy that seeks the destruction of hospitals. These are historical facts. To dispute this would make you a liar or delusional.

You still have not presented any substance.

I have done nothing amounting to concern trolling. Please stop using buzz phrases that you don't know the correct usage of.

Now try to respond without using the the same three phrases you've been using over and over.

Else, little boy, please get off the internet. You shouldn't be using it without parental supervision.

Logical fallacies is new too. More big words that you're using without not really knowing what they mean.

But I was attacked more than ever by the left. Finally one day in 2018 I realized I was no long on the fence. I was a full fledged Trump supporter. After 20 years of supporting the left. Since that day my support for Trump has only gotten stronger and my dislike of the democrat party has as well. And now they want to defund the police. No thanks.

EVERYONE, regardless of political affiliation NEEDS to watch this, as it very clearly and succinctly – and with tremendous evidence providing example after example – debunks Nadler’s and the rest of the dems’ false narrative that the “protests” are peaceful and the violence is a “myth”. Anyone who refuses to watch it is simply choosing to ignore the truth, as there is no other excuse. Clearly BLM and Antifa are NOT peacefully protesting - rather they have been committing REAL terrorism and violence and are threatening to continue to do so, and as such have now been proven to truly be terrorists. These are the very same words and actions we have heard from terror groups such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hezbollah and Hamas. Anyone who still supports BLM and Antifa are no different.

In point of fact, Antifa / BLM is the exact antithesis of what their name suggests – their actions prove that they are the true fascists. They violently oppose anyone with whom they disagree – often times to the point of deadly physical violence and death itself. They are responsible for the brutal killing and destruction of countless American lives – and in this particular case the majority of the lives and livelihoods they are destroying are those of Black Americans. Yet this is who the dems support – Joe Biden has donated money to bail them out of jail. Keith Ellison (the former Chairman of the DNC) has openly declared his support of Antifa, and his son just did so this past week. The mayor of Berkeley has proudly boasted about him being a card-carrying member of Antifa. Countless other dems, including each of the members of the “Squad” and even those who are less “extreme” also support and defend them.

You can protest for any reason. 

Its not a reason to stage a Marxist revolution. Its not a reason to riot. Its not a reason to burn down federal courthouses. Its not a reason to defun the police. 



&gt;Shark attacks are documented. Do you believe all police abuse is documented? 

Do you believe all shark attacks are documented? 

&gt;&gt;	Its objectively less of a problem than it was. Without months of rioting and arson and looting and murder.

&gt;But it’s still a problem. 

One that will continue to exist until policing is done by robots or until policing itself is obsolete. 

&gt;&gt;	Not as many, no.

&gt;Where are you getting your numbers from? 

What numbers? What are you talking about? These questions are not appropriate to the things I am saying. 

&gt;This shows the deaths have vastly dropped.

Yes.... I know. Aids isnt as much of a risk as it used to be. Just likw police violence. 

&gt;&gt;	Will you still stay at home and not work once this pandemic is over? Covid will still be a problem but with decreased risk comes decreased precautions.

&gt;But to get to that point of decreased risk, you need to take major precautions. 

And we are already at a point of decreased risk of police violence. And that risk is steadily decreasing. 

&gt;&gt;	The fact that its exclusively left wing riots by left wingers for left wing causes.

&gt;There have been (as in the past) people not on the left who have been instigating and committing crimes in the midst of protests. 

Theyre not the ones rioting. Theyre not the ones attacking officers and burning down federal buildings. Stop pushing goalposts. 


&gt;No. But it’s the right wing that doesn’t acknowledge that police abuse is a problem. 

So? That isnt a crime. Believing statistics as opposed to fringe left wing conspiracy theories is not a crime. Rioting is. 


&gt;That’s part of the problem. 

Says you. I say the problem is left wingers committing all the crimes. 

&gt;&gt;	Did you know joe biden made defunding police part of his platform?

Yes. It is a bad thing to defund the police.

7/25/2020,"The coalition that elected Trump in 2016 wasn't all that different demographically than previous GOP victories.   Trump won White voters by +21 points over Hillary while Hillary won Black voters by +80 points and Hispanic voters by +36 points.   In terms of gender, Trump won the male voter by +12 points and Hillary won the female vote by +12 points.   In terms of age, Trump won the over 65 demographic by +8 points while Hillary won the 18 - 29 demographic by +18 points.   On the surface this looks like the same older, white, males plus evangelicals coalition that has been the core of every Republican strategy.  But it wasn't.

Traditionally, Republican candidates have had to pivot to the center after the primaries to at least split the moderates and independent while relying on dog whistle messaging and SuperPAC proxies to keep their ideological, racist and evangelical base engaged.   

Trump didn't do dog whistles very well.  Instead he threw bomb after bomb at the GOP establishment.   He pandered to evangelicals with the Pence pick, but he didn't have to pivot because enough moderates and independents viscerally hated Hillary enough that he was still able to garner 42% of women voters after the Billy Bush tape came out.   

Since being elected, Trump has basically replayed the same script over and over. Troll the Libs from Twitter, brag, gloat, lie, throw red meat to his base while throwing bombs at the GOP establishment.    It's the only strategy Trump knows, but is it a good strategy for 2020?

* The covid-19 pandemic has changed the landscape.  Many seniors to not appreciate being treated as sacrificial.   It's also hard to hide the incompetence. Americans can put up with a dumb President, but not a manifestly incompetent one.
* The inability to hold hate rallies has removed Trump's most effective campaign tool.
* The racial unrest and Trump administration response to it, following the brutal police killings for Floyd George, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery has mobilized Blacks, progressives and younger voters.   Hillary won these demographics, but they did not turn out in high numbers.  That may be changing.

His law and order approach to the demonstrations only resonates with those who were already committed to voting for him - the roughly 40% resistance line we see on his approval rating.

His on-going denial and lack of leadership on covid-19 is alienating  seniors, independents and moderate republicans.

The world isn’t black and white. Me saying that trump (a man who cannot understand basic numbers, see his interview recently) is a fucking idiot, does not mean that I think Biden, a completely unrelated human being to the topic I’m touching on, is a genius.

They’re both old farts who have no business running the most powerful country in the world at their age.

Trump has contributed to 140,000+ deaths of Americans by spreading misinformation to OBVIOUSLY benefit himself. His only motive is to boost the economy and get re-elected and line his wallet with cash. He does not care about you, he certainly doesn’t care about me, and he doesn’t care about the well being of the average American.

If you cannot see this, then you are also an idiot and are clearly brainwashed by right wing news outlets.

Unfortunately in the two party system we are spoon fed, we must choose between these two nearly brain dead bags of shit.

The majority of Americans would choose Biden because they care about the vast number of Americans that trump has contributed towards killing or hurting.

Voting for Biden isn’t saying Biden is a genius. It’s saying that trump is just a worse option.

The racism debate is a tiring point and has no affect on me. Racism will always exist, although it’s no coincidence that all KKK members and swastika wearing donkey brained scum bags are supporting trump. 

To me that doesn’t say that trump is a nazi, nor does the racism controversy affect my opinion of trump.

At the end of the day millions of Americans are still unemployed because of the poor handling of an epidemic - one that the majority of American presidential cabinets would’ve had some plan to contain, regardless of left vs right. Instead trump is looking for ways to make money by promoting brands and forcing Americans to die to go back to their shitty job, while furloughed people make more money sitting on unemployment.

This is why trump needs to go. He’s destroying the country for the benefit of himself and his money hungry cronies",-0.0213

Biden by contrast has been aggressive for quite a while

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/02/joe-biden-not-plotting-overthrow-venezuela-president

&gt;“What vice-president Jose Biden did has no name,” Maduro said. “Vice-president Biden: Look me in the eyes. I saw you in Brazil, I gave you my hand. You, who said this is a new era for relations in Latin America, were going to conspire against Venezuela.”

8/5/2020,"I'm from the United States.

No, the economy was not great before Covid.  Farming and manufacturing were already in a deep recession.  Economists were already predicting a nation-wide recession long before Covid hit.  Every single Republican administration in the last 50 years has caused a recession without a pandemic.  And Trump and the GOP's response to the pandemic is the reason the economy got hit so hard. Do I need to point out to you that Trump and the GOP have been actively engaged in genocide?

We're definitely near Civil War tensions.  Trump is actively trying to incite a civil war.  His supporters are calling for all Democrats to be killed.  

Our institutions refer to checks and balances, separation of powers, the rule of law, diplomacy, the justice system.  All of them are being destroyed.  In fact, there is no rule of law at the federal level anymore because the DoJ only does Trump's bidding.  Attorney General Barr has been actively purging any federal prosecutor who is involved with investigating Trump, and installing his own corrupt lackies to shut down the investigations.  

Democracy is already being sabotaged.  Trump is actively cheating as we speak.  This will be the largest mail-in voting election in US history, and Trump installed a right-wing donor with zero experience to run the US Postal service, and the first thing he does is sabotage the postal service, delay mail by weeks, and close numerous post offices.  Trump is intentionally doing that to harm mail-in votes.  Trump has spent months claiming mail-in voting is a fraud and leads to cheating (despite him doing mail in voting), yet now he's saying it's ok if Florida does it, but he's suing Nevada to stop mail-in voting. He admitted the only reason Florida is allowed is because it's Republican, and Nevada is Democratic.

Trump's Attorney General is actively fabricating a nonsense investigation into Joe Biden to drop in October to swing the election like Comey did in 2016.

Republicans in Congress are directly working with Russia and other foreign adversaries to steal this election for Trump.  They're even discussing taking away the option from the States and invoking the 20th Amendment to allow the House to decide the 2020 election, which would be an automatic Trump win.

Republicans are actively suppressing the votes of Democratic minority voters.  They're closing hundreds of polling stations, purging hundreds of thousands of minority votes, etc.

It's clear that you have no idea how bad things are in this country.  Trump is actively trying to steal the 2020 election by illegal means and the entire Republican party and most Evangelicals are helping him.  That's been proven numerous times.  If Trump wins again, America will be a fascist dictatorship 100% guaranteed.",-0.0211

8/12/2020,"Lets take the first example.

Christopher Boswell was already convicted of kidnapping, raping and torturing two women in 1999-2000. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In one case, he kidnapped and raped a woman and threatened to kill her, beating her in the head repeatedly before pushing her out of a moving vehicle and attempting to run her over as she fled. The victim walked 12 blocks half-nude and covered in bruises when she was found by a routine patrol. The other victim was a minor.

Then after being released from prison, Boswell failed to register as a predatory offender and was imprisoned again, but release again in 2019.

Then in January this year, Boswell stalked and kidnapped a woman at gunpoint, forcing her into a van. He punched her repeatedly in the face and knocked out several of her teeth, sexually assaulted her and dragged her by her hair into the back seat while saying he was going to murder her, striking her over the head with a broken glass bottle. She struggled with him to jump out of the moving van as he grabbed her by the neck to stop her, but she wriggled free and fell, suffering cuts and bruises, a nasal fracture and other injuries.

Boswell, who was already convicted of those previous two kidnappings, rapes and tortures at gunpoint, was due to stand trial for this third one. For which he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. He was given a $250,000 bail by a judge that deemed him too much of a threat to the public to release with anything Boswell could actually afford to pay. While already in custody, Boswell was identified and charged with *another* kidnapping in 2018. In that incident, Boswell kidnapped two women at gunpoint and forced them into his vehicle, pistol whipped them repeatedly and choked them, drove them to a remote location where he forced them out of the vehicle, kicked them in the face repeatedly and lined one woman against a wall while he held a gun to her head. He counted to three and then fired his gun in the air. He was given an additional $100,000 bail to keep him in on that charge too.

Tammy Duckworth Is Nothing and Everything Like Joe Biden

&gt;Senator Tammy Duckworth, like the man she might serve as vice president, prizes loyalty in her ranks and occasional mischief in her workplace.

&gt;So when a top communications aide prepared to defect last year to the presidential campaign of Pete Buttigieg, Ms. Duckworth recognized an opportunity. She recorded a faux media interview trashing Mr. Buttigieg for hiring her staff away, recruiting an intern to pose as a journalist on the tape. The file was sent to the departing aide, Sean Savett, who called the Buttigieg team in a panic.

&gt;Soon, Mr. Savett was summoned to the Illinois senator’s office, where she fumed theatrically, stalling as other staff members filed in quietly for the reveal: It was all a ruse.

It will be incredibly difficult for both of them.

7/29/2020,"Last comment was removed cause I said a bad word 

Okay no matter how bad things get there will not be a civil war. Civil war comes from a states failure to maintain a control on violence, and if the US military is good at anything it is violence. Furthermore neither democrats nor republicans are going to rise up in arms because of an election. Most people have enough trouble rising out of bed.  Finally literally every election people talk about a coup or the president not standing down or whatever, and it’s never happened. Take a deep breath, relax, and realize that it will be much more boring. 

So let’s talk worst case scenario, best case scenario, and most likely to happen awful scenario because we live in terrible world or (MLtHASBWLiTW for short)

Best scenario: someone wins a direct victory and the peaceful transition or maintaining of power continues once again. 

Worst Scenario (and incredibly unlikely): both sides claim victory and we have a soft bloodless military coup where the US government is essentially appointed by the military 

I cannot stress how unlikely this is. If Trump loses and refuses to step down or if Biden loses and um tweets about it? Neither have a base that would actually jeopardize the systems in place because they’re largest voting block is 60+. Often times people say stupid stuff on the internet because they’re on the internet and this is not reality, but more a playground for that sociopath gene in all of us.

MLtHASBWLiHW: Trump loses the election calls it illegitimate and begins a lengthy legal process, during which time he may or may not be forcibly removed from office. Once again no blood is spilled, more people lose faith in American democracy, and by 2021 or 22 Biden is president. 

Trump could try a coup, but frankly he needs the actual support of the military (over Joe Biden, who isn’t exactly a radical reformer). If Joe Biden wins it’s not like he’ll cut funding to the military drastically.

with Brent D. Griffiths

A payroll tax cut, one of President Trump’s top priorities for the coronavirus relief package, officially went belly-up Thursday. Trump just days ago suggested he might veto a package that didn’t include it. 

The president blamed Democrats for its failure to move forward, but objections from Republicans sunk it on Capitol Hill. Its fate is just one example of the broader mess consuming Republican negotiations on the next round of emergency relief for an increasingly shaky economy – and the political risks. 

Republican infighting is hobbling progress at a moment the party can least afford it. 

With Trump down in the polls against former vice president Joe Biden and Senate Republicans at risk of losing their majority, the pressure's on for the GOP to unite swiftly around a plan to keep the economic crisis from growing worse. Instead, with critical lifelines to strapped Americans set to expire in days, party leaders are presiding over a needlessly late and haphazard process before even presenting their plan to Democrats. 
Republicans are still divided on multiple key issues. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was expected on Thursday morning to roll out the Republican answer to the $3 trillion relief package House Democrats approved in May. Instead, ongoing rifts between Senate Republican leaders and the Trump administration — and among factions of the Senate GOP — forced McConnell to delay its debut.

AD
The major points of disagreement:

The overall cost. “They had said they wanted the package to be roughly $1 trillion, but the GOP plan has fueled fierce internal divisions about the size and scope of the government response as lawmakers have digested grim polling news about the party’s standing ahead of the November elections,” Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim, and Jeff Stein report.
The process for approving the relief. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Thursday endorsed breaking up the package to immediately move a stand-alone measure extending enhanced unemployment benefits. “Democrats and Republicans immediately shot down the idea,” per my colleagues.
What to do about the expiring unemployment benefits. Senate Republican opinion has run the gamut, from stopping the $600 weekly payments cold to extending them at their current rate. Top Republicans have settled on a plan that could cut the average payment to $200 a week, the New York Times’s Jim Tankersley and Ben Casselman report. But it faces logistical hurdles.
Trump's push on the FBI building. The White House is pushing for language addressing the location of the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, a longtime hobbyhorse of the president’s with no apparent relevance to the pandemic response, per Post reporting.
A Lindsey Graham special. The South Carolina Republican is demanding the inclusion of a provision related to manufacturing and China that is drawing pushback from colleagues.
Where Republicans agree, at least in broad strokes:
McConnell, in a Senate floor speech, said the Republican proposal would include a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks, more funds for coronavirus testing, and “liability reform setting up legal protections to make it hard for employees to sue their employers if they become sick at work,” Erica, Seung Min and Jeff report.

More from the Post team: “The emerging GOP bill also was expected to include $70 billion for elementary and secondary schools, with half of that money connected to schools physically reopening their classrooms. No new money for state and local governments was expected, but instead the legislation would allow local leaders more flexibility in spending $150 billion allocated in the Cares Act in March. Tax credits were expected to encourage businesses to retain workers and help them enact safety protections in workplaces. Another round of funding for the small-business Paycheck Protection Program was also expected.”

Republicans are scrambling now because they waited weeks to start crafting their proposal.
As we wrote here back on June 30, “Evidence keeps mounting that a wobbly economic recovery is poised to lose its footing as states and businesses ratchet back reopening plans in the face of spiking case counts. But the party remains divided, both on Capitol Hill and within the White House, about the necessity of pumping out more federal money to shore it up. And GOP leaders are evincing little urgency about acting in the immediate term.”

AD
The public health and economic crises have both degraded significantly since. “There have been 4 million confirmed U.S. cases of the virus, far more than any other country,” my colleagues note. “More than 140,000 people have died, including 3,000 since Tuesday. In addition, 1.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, up from 1.3 million the week before, the first time there was a week-over-week increase in several months.”",-0.0158

Saying that CNN constantly pushes fake news which makes it better than Fox News is quite ridiculous seeing as Fox News quite openly lie.

 Take for example the Australian bushfires earlier this year. I'm Australian so this example is just the easiest for me to bring up. Anyway, they reported that a majority of the fires were started by arsonists, despite the fact that this was debunked multiple times and instead he blame was being put on a rising temperature and drought in regional Australia. The fires were not arson related, they were caused by climate change. However, Fox News repeatedly published articles claiming that it was in fact arsonists who caused the fires. This then led to Trump tweeting out fake news claiming this exact thing. The resident of the united states tweeted an article that had been debunked and still claimed that it was true. This is fake news.

CNN does less of blatantly lying and more of bending of the truth, both are bad. However, those that watch CNN are at least not a victim of headlines like “sleepy joe Biden supports radical left terrorist group Antifa”.

&gt;But here in Pennsylvania — home to one of the largest populations of residents age 65 or older and where suburbanites comprise more than half of the electorate — their defection to Joe Biden is hurting Trump even more acutely.

Imposes a 12.4 percent Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (Social Security) payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. This would create a “donut hole” in the current Social Security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed.[1]

Reverts the top individual income tax rate for taxable incomes above $400,000 from 37 percent under current law to the pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of 39.6 percent.

Taxes long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the ordinary income tax rate of 39.6 percent on income above $1 million and eliminates step-up in basis for capital gains taxation.[2]

Caps the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 28 percent of value, which means that taxpayers in the brackets with tax rates higher than 28 percent will face limited itemized deductions.

Restores the Pease limitation on itemized deductions for taxable incomes above $400,000.

Phases out the qualified business income deduction (Section 199A) for filers with taxable income above $400,000.

Expands the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for childless workers aged 65+; provides renewable-energy-related tax credits to individuals.

They had a super majority and we still didn’t get a public option because Dems govern from center right and pander to the opposition every time. If they can’t pass meaningful legislation with a super majority what makes you think a public option is happening now? Typical democratic platitudes and bullshit. 

Since you mentioned the public option ask yourself why it’s in the platform at all. Biden said he doesn’t support Medicare for all, during a fucking pandemic and somehow you think that the platform matters. Not to mention he knows who has control of the senate right now. It’s almost comical. More platitudes. 

They literally took a knee in kente cloth, but don’t want to legalize Marijuana knowing that it’s helping to fuel the war on drugs. Make that make sense. They don’t give a shit. It’s all a show. They don’t want to stop the drug war, because their donors are profiting off of it. Why do you think Biden was quick to be against the premise of defunding the police? He’s a hardcore moderate who made his career off of a crime bill that targets black and brown people. He is also in the pocket of companies that profit from providing equipment to police departments around the country. Do the research on Safariland and who they are financed by and who they donated to. Biden. Biden is getting money from the people that made the tear gas that was used on peaceful protestors. The irony in that is crazy considering Biden saw an increase in fundraising after that.

He has donors that have supported republican candidates, make that make sense. You are too fucking stupid to realize you are a pawn in a game of chess that involves the people(pawns) always being sacrificed first. 

Joe Biden green-lit asset forfeiture, incentivized mass incarceration, cheer leaded on mandatory minimums and the militarization of the police. It’s democratic policy that has helped fuel the drug war. So again, you can fuck off. They don’t care about the people. It’s all platitudes.

Politics in general has been more vicious and in/out group than tolerant these days. I don’t think they’re the average left winger, but i think it’s a popular movement for those who are more left wing. Some have pushed it to the point where you’re considered a conservative to them if you don’t have opinions similar to them. 

With the media, i tend to ignore the opinions of reporters, pundits and commentators and try to focus on the factual information. I try to also focus on less biased sources. Make no mistake though, this is something happening both from the left and right wings. If you’re black and not conservative, some will deem you a “mental slave on a DNC plantation” and also use points similar to what you’ve said about being called a coon and race traitor, but with black conservatives. They ironically don’t see that suggesting that blacks vote the way they do because they’ve been tricked, and not based on their own beliefs and opinions is also racist. 

The fact that some on the left see colorblindness as a problem rather than an attempt towards egalitarianism Is problematic for me. 

Also, i think Joe Biden was trying to joke, but failed miserably. If he’s being serious about that comment, he’s not the only one. He joins Trump, who claimed that “if you’re a jew and vote democrat, you’re betraying Israel”.

Honestly i don’t like Biden or Trump, but i believe Biden can do a better job in keeping the social fabric of the country together than Trump, who’s literally making no good attempt to bring the country together.

The U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts, alarming postal workers who warn that the policies could undermine their ability to deliver ballots on time for the November election.
As President Trump ramps up his unfounded attacks on mail balloting as being susceptible to widespread fraud, postal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting.
The backlog comes as the president, who is trailing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the polls, has escalated his efforts to cast doubt about the integrity of the November vote, which is expected to yield record numbers of mail ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Thursday, Trump floated the idea of delaying the Nov. 3 general election, a notion that was widely condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. He has repeatedly gone after the Postal Service, recently suggesting that the agency cannot be trusted to deliver ballots.
DeJoy, a North Carolina logistics executive who donated more than $2 million to GOP political committees in the past four years, approved changes that took effect July 13 that the agency said were aimed at cutting costs for the debt-laden mail service. They included prohibiting overtime pay, shutting down sorting machines early and requiring letter carriers to leave mail behind when necessary to avoid extra trips or late delivery on routes.
Postal Service memos detail ‘difficult’ changes, including slower mail delivery
The new policies have resulted in at least a two-day delay in scattered parts of the country, even for express mail, according to multiple postal workers and union leaders. Letter carriers are manually sorting more mail, adding to the delivery time. Bins of mail ready for delivery are sitting in post offices because of scheduling and route changes. And without the ability to work overtime, workers say the logjam is worsening without an end in sight.
As states look to dramatically expand the use of mail-in ballots this fall, postal workers across the country said the changes could lead to chaos in November.
“I’m actually terrified to see election season under the new procedure,” said Lori Cash, president of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) Local 183 in Western New York.
David Partenheimer, spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service, said the recent changes aim to stabilize the agency after decades of financial woes. The procedures are not meant to slow the delivery of ballots or any other mail, he said, also asserting that any problems will be short-lived.
“Of course we acknowledge that temporary service impacts can occur . . . but any such impacts will be monitored and temporary,” Partenheimer said.
Partenheimer said that claims that DeJoy takes directions from Trump are “wholly misplaced and off-base,” noting that the postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan board of governors.
In a meeting with DeJoy on Thursday, the head of one of the nation’s largest postal workers unions said he shared the “deep concerns” of postal workers that the new procedures are causing mounting backlogs that could affect the election.
“I vehemently weighed in that this is wrong,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the APWU, which represents more than 200,000 postal employees and retirees. “It’s wrong for the people of the country, it’s wrong for the public Postal Service. It drives away business and revenue. And it’s wrong for the workers.”
Dimondstein said DeJoy told him that he is committed to mail voting and providing full assistance to states as they run their elections.
“I plan, and the people of the country plan, to hold him to his word,” the union leader said.
Voters and postal workers have reported scattered problems across the country in recent days, including in key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, raising concerns among residents whether their states are being targeted because of their importance in the presidential and Senate elections.
In Michigan, which is gearing up for its Aug. 4 primary, election administrators said they have fielded complaints from voters who had not yet received their ballots as of this week. Election clerks are advising voters to drop off their ballot Tuesday rather than sending it back via mail, out of fear that the ballots will not be returned in time to be counted.
“I don’t think it’s a widespread issue, but anytime we get mail delayed, especially first class, or not delivered at all, it becomes a concern,” said Phil Kerns, the city clerk of Frankenmuth, in the central part of Michigan.
The upheaval inside the Postal Service has sparked condemnation from top Democrats. Speaking on Thursday at a service memorializing the late representative John Lewis, former president Barack Obama decried “those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting . . . even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that’s going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”
And four Senate Democrats wrote to DeJoy on Thursday, demanding information about the new procedures, calling them “questionable.”
“Your failure to provide Congress with relevant information about these recent changes or to clarify to postal employees what changes you have directed as Postmaster General, undermines public trust and only increases concerns that service compromises will grow in advance of the election and peak mail volumes in November,” wrote Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.).
The delays are especially alarming given the impending flood of campaign and election mail and a potential resurgence of coronavirus cases in the fall that could lead to staff shortages, Postal Service employees said. Their frustrations have led some to dub the new postmaster “Louie DeLay” in private, several workers said.
“I’m a little frightened. By the time political season rolls around, I shudder to think what it’s going to look like,” said a postal employee in Pennsylvania, who, like many others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
In a meeting Wednesday with Ronnie Stutts, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers Association, DeJoy said his relationship with the president does not affect his decisions at the agency, Stutts said.
“I asked him, ‘Do you know that your president who you support . . . is not real high on voting by mail? He don’t like that.’ And he said, ‘Let me tell you something. . . . My relationship with the president is not going to have anything to do with me doing my job,’ ” said Stutts, who said he believes the changes will make the agency more efficient.
A shift at the USPS
Trump has repeatedly gone after the Postal Service, calling it “a joke” and demanding it raise the rates it charges companies such as Amazon. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) In recent months, the administration has sought to leverage the agency’s financial woes, made worse by the pandemic and declines in profitable first- and second-class mail. On Wednesday, the Postal Service agreed to give the Treasury Department information about its private-sector contracts in exchange for a $10 billion emergency loan authorized by Congress in an early round of coronavirus relief spending.
Weeks after DeJoy took over, agency officials released an internal memo announcing a “pivot” for all employees.
Traditionally, postal workers are trained not to leave letters behind and to make multiple delivery trips to ensure mail is delivered on time — which can incur extra costs in overtime hours, transportation and more.
Officials laid out a shift away from this approach, saying that such practices cost the organization about $200 million in added expenses, according to the memo, which was obtained by The Post.
Among the changes is a new, strict cutoff time in the morning for mail carriers to pick up items to deliver that day, several postal employees from three different states said.
The machines that typically sort mail and prepare them for pickup by carriers are being shut down earlier in some areas to cut costs, requiring carriers to sort more mail by hand once they arrive in the morning.
That means any mail that is not ready by cutoff time waits at least another day. And if there is any error in hand-sorted mail, it needs to be rerouted to another carrier — which could lead to three to four extra days of waiting. As a result of these changes, guaranteed shipping dates are not being met, the employees said.",-0.0132

8/8/2020,"No, but it was certainly the straw that broke the camels back.

Some reporters manufactured fake documents and posted them in a slack group to make it look like Sanders was telling his campaign to attack Warren. We know these documents are fake because of an exchange with the “journalist” on twitter. The documents were called out for not being official on and the “journalists” who wrote the story said that no they totally said they were official but the copies they posted had to be edited to protect the confidentiality of the source. Which is a lie because there was no reason for the sources name to be on those documents and instead of just blacking out info they’d erased it entirely. Also the documents were up for a few minutes at most in the slack group before getting deleted. So it’s a hell of a coincidence that in that short time span someone with the campaign would download these fake documents and go to the press without even bothering to confirm their authenticity with the campaign because they were so concerned. 

Warren was then asked about this on camera and without bothering to vet the story gave an angry reply. Right after that the “Bernie is sexist” story was sourced by a reporter embedded with the Warren campaign. A story that only two other people aside from Sanders and Warren knew about both of whom were with the Warren campaign so it’s pretty obvious after failing to vet the original story the Warren campaign retaliated by leaking the story about Sanders being a sexist.

Problem is that original story was bullshit and the media didn’t run with it because it completely falls apart under the most cursory scrutiny. So now Warren’s campaign has publicly gone nuclear on Sanders over something that didn’t happen, which is not a good look. It was all over at that point. If you look at how Warren was dodging questions about the Sanders is sexist leak it seems like they’d finally gotten around to vetting the original story. Warren realized that she’d just blown up the united progressive front over literal fake news. Warren couldn’t back down because public perception would have tanked her campaign instantly, the only chance the campaign had was to hope this story was enough to sink Sanders. 

But the revelation that she and not Sanders had fired the first shot clearly shook Warren enough that selling the lie about Sanders being a sexist with any authenticity wasn’t something she could pull off. Her motivation went from righteous indignation to oh no I fucked up now it’s too late to do anything about it. I don’t think Warren is completely without principals and even though she ultimately stood by the lie in the debate it was uncomfortable enough for her to do so that no one was buying the act. Remember for such a juicy anti Sanders story the media actually dropped that one fairly quickly. Probably because Sanders isn’t actually a sexist and to keep it up the Warren campaign would have had to actively manufacture misinformation not just willfully misinterpret what Sanders had said. 

By the time Pete dropped out Warren had done what a lot of people do and rationalized her own fuck up into being the fault of the person she had wronged so she refused to drop out and endorse Sanders, now I’m stuck voting for Joe fucking Biden.",-0.0126

8/3/2020,"&gt;**Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November**  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts, alarming postal workers who warn that the policies could undermine their ability to deliver ballots on time for the November election.  
&gt;  
&gt;As President Trump ramps up his unfounded attacks on mail balloting as being susceptible to widespread fraud, postal employees and union officials say the changes implemented by Trump fundraiser-turned-postmaster general Louis DeJoy are contributing to a growing perception that mail delays are the result of a political effort to undermine absentee voting.  
&gt;  
&gt;The backlog comes as the president, who is trailing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee [Joe Biden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/joe-biden/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8) in the polls, has escalated his efforts to cast doubt about the integrity of the November vote, which is expected to yield record numbers of mail ballots because of the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8) pandemic.

They included prohibiting overtime pay, shutting down sorting machines early and requiring letter carriers to leave mail behind when necessary to avoid extra trips or late delivery on routes.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new policies have resulted in at least a two-day delay in scattered parts of the country, even for express mail, according to multiple postal workers and union leaders. Letter carriers are manually sorting more mail, adding to the delivery time. Bins of mail ready for delivery are sitting in post offices because of scheduling and route changes. And without the ability to work overtime, workers say the logjam is worsening without an end in sight.

I also feel that he is senile. I think he’s more of a puppet than we want to believe. &amp; what makes it WORSE in my mind is that the dems do nothing but deny deny deny despite all the proof on some of this shit. The DNC IS FUCKING CORRUPT but nobody gives a fuck for some reason. Oh, trump. It’s irrational. Nobody remember when the DNC literally cheated bernie out of the nom? Oh but the dems are all saints. 

A prime example of this would be Nancy Pelosi pettily tipping up Trump’s state of the union address. Like, really? Really. You’re gonna fucking lower us to HIS childlike level and do some immature shit like that for the WHOLE WORLD TO SEE?! It’s shit like that. They are the SAME but act like they’re so different. &amp; people eat it the fuck up 

I know these are old, trodden and sensitive subjects, because people want trump out so badly. I do too. But there are so many inconsistencies, coincidences, and things the media simply chooses not to talk about. 

Aaaall the while, the left pro ports itself to be the saving grace and only choice the American people have left in order to avoid complete catastrophe. I don’t trust them, I don’t trust the republicans even more. But the seemingly sinister actions from the left that scream hypocrisy &amp; greed do not sit right with me. 

Anyone who says they’re the only choice, the “right” choice, deserves not to be put up for said choice at all. 

It’s like, we’re supposed to be better than all the bullshit we see on the right. We’re supposed to be examples of stand up citizens who do the RIGHT things, but at every turn im given another example of how someone on the left has betrayed the trust of the American people for person or monetary gains. It’s sickening.

# Joe Biden fuels election conspiracy theory while the media keeps quiet

It is a conspiracy theory utterly without factual or constitutional support, yet his warning was deemed a “prediction” by Politico in a* [*recent article*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/23/biden-trump-2020-delay-coronavirus-206142)*.

So we have been doing it King’s way, correct? 

Yet here we are some 50 odd years later having the same discussion. 

And the Democrats (liberals) answer is a former segregationist as their presidential nominee1*, burning down black businesses2*, killing more black people3*,killing more people in general from protests4*, defunding police at the behest of black people5*, and then blaming conservatives for their failures. 

Even though some of the cities have been Democrat controlled for 30 years+.

Its hard to imagine the kind of mental gymnastics you need to say this. We had Joe Biden as VP in one of the most scandal free boring presidencies in living memory. 

Then we elected Trump and felt like we were going to war with major militaries constantly, losing allies constantly, a trade war that decimated industries, race riots and federal storm troopers, a literal fucking plague and recession made much worse by horrible handling by a guy who said we wouldn't get more than 15 cases when it started, literal fucking nazis marching under his name and to top it all off he has one of the most polarizing alienating personalities you can get with a president. 

&gt;Tax everyone to the extreme and appoint people based on race and sex not experience and qualifications.

he said of the candidate who would be the 45th white guy out of 46 presidents.

Also again its worth noting Trump just recently canned his campaign manager. That is not a move that someone confident in their internal polling does. You don't fire your campaign manager unless things are going poorly and you are trying to find a strategy to fix a sinking ship.

7/31/2020,"Well I’m sorry for those people. But I think it’s bad to group every trump supporter in a box as racist because they support a president who led to the lowest African American unemployment rate ever recorded, a president that increased funding more than any other president to history African American schools, signed an Executive Order to get 3,000 people so far out of jail (90% of which were African American), created a [task force ](https://www.originalpechanga.com/2020/07/trump-administration-establishes-first.html) to find missing Native American children, and created Opportunity Zones to help increase home ownership and create businesses in poor neighborhoods. 

But you never hear about those in mainstream media. I didn’t vote for Trump the first time because I believed all the hysterics that he was a racist and I could never support a racist. But actions speak louder than words and he’s done a ton for all Americans including minorities. I am not telling you this to become a Trump supporter or anything. I am only adding it to not assume someone is a racist because they support Trump. 

There are racists on both sides.  [Gun control laws ](https://www.libertynation.com/the-racist-history-of-the-gun-control-movement/) have a very racist history. The first gun control laws were to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans. California got stricter gun control laws once the blacks panthers started legally carrying around firearms. 

[The first minimum wage laws ](https://www.cato.org/publications/briefing-paper/davisbacon-act-lets-bring-jim-crow-end) were created to keep unionized whites in the labor force and get African Americans and immigrants out.

8/5/2020,"I don't like Trump. At all. And I she he's been disastrous as a president, maybe in ways that we don't even really know yet, but will become clear in the future as we look back on the effects.

That's said, I don't think I can bring myself to vote for Biden. He a terrible candidate and always has been. The only reason he looks reasonable right now is because the pandemic has really limited his non-scripted comments. Normally by this time he'd be swimming in gaffes while Trump would be laughing all the way back to a second term. The pandemic has been Biden's saving grace if you ask me.

But it's not just the gaffes, although I'm convinced we world have had some doozies by now, Biden is also a champion of the status quo. Keeping the same old corrupt people in power, and doubling down on the same poor policies. Maybe he won't be as ridiculous as Trump every single day, but he's not really going to bring respect and dignity back to the White House, he'll just be a placeholder. 

And then there's his health and age. If people think Trump has dementia, Biden frequently forgets what he's even talking about mid sentence. I've seriously seen Democrats say straight faced that voting for Biden won't be so much about if he'll be a good president, but they are looking at his running mate. Like seriously, they are already planning for his death and the take over of the vice president. Sounds like a real winning strategy there. 

Look, I don't have Joe Biden as person. But when people wanted him to run I was scratching my head, because dude needs to go retire and be an old fogey somewhere nice. Not running the country. I still don't understand how he's the anointed one for the Democratic party. But here we are once again, two very poor candidates, and whoever wins it'll be a crap shoot.

7/26/2020,"Saying I’m against equality isn’t fair. Things have been (legally) fair for decades. I know there is some corruption and some racism out there, but it’s not like the media is making it out to be. I am a woman. I’ve been more qualified than a man for a position and lost because he was a man. I had someone tell me they “already had too much estrogen in the office”. I also was not chosen for a position because the manager knew I was pregnant. I don’t think that’s very “fair”. It’s definitely discrimination. I’ve never been targeted for the color of my skin, but I’ve also been pulled over by three cops. (2 speeding, 1 expired tag). Guess what? I complied and didn’t get into any further trouble. The cop that pulled me over accused me of stealing the vehicle to try and scare me (I was half a mile away from my house getting a coffee and was a teenager living with my parents at the time) and then he told me “make sure Daddy pays for your tag this month, sweetheart”. I mean the guy was a dick but I just did what he asked, and he let me go. 

There’s a video circulating that my blue cousin in NY shared to his Facebook. A black man starts filming in his car, and there are officers outside of his car. It’s obvious they’ve been trying to get him to step out of his vehicle for some time, and this guy is pulling the “BLM” card. The officer is being a smart ass. I would be too at that point. The man keeps saying “I’m afraid for my life. I’m not doing anything” and the officer is like “just step out of the car, you aren’t complying.” Long story short, the guy lives. But the officer reached into his car and unbuckled his seatbelt and opened the car door to cuff him. I’m assuming there was a lot of talking beforehand we didn’t see until they wanted him out of the car. Then magically he films it, and looks like he’s doing all the right things and the “big bad officer” is threatening him. And the comments on the video are unreal. “This is why black lives matter. Fuck cops! That guy needs to be in jail and fired!”

Give me a break. 

If you don’t see how BLM (excuse me, ActBlue) is trying to divide this country, idk if I have the energy to try and convince you. I’ll maybe send a few of my “main point” opinions and see if you can think from my perspective:

All donations to BLM go to ActBlue. That’s campaign money straight into the Left’s pockets. It’s not going to help black communities much. Most of it went to Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, etc. look it up! You can find it easily. Click a link to donate to BLM, it will redirect you to ActBlue’s website. You can click a link and see exactly where it goes!

Here’s my personal take: The Democrats (as in the “higher-ups” not the average citizen) are trying to divide the country. Idk exactly what all for, but it can’t be good. They are baiting white people in. “Put this as your profile pic or you don’t care about black people” “come to protests or you don’t care about black lives” “if you don’t support BLM you’re a racist and hate us and want us killed” just stupid stuff all the time! 

Of course I care about black people. I have black friends who I’d do anything for. But just because I’m not going to go protest (which turns into riots way too often. And don’t try and tell me “not all protests are riots” in my opinion ONE looting riot damages your credibility) does NOT mean I don’t care. I just don’t agree with raising money for Democratic campaigns while simultaneously preying on black people (making them think this is actually about equality for them) and white people (digging through their souls to make them feel guilty for what their great-great-great-great grandparents did). 

And I’ll be the first to admit I know the system was (and is, but to a MUCH lighter extent) totally fucked. Slavery should’ve never been a thing. Black people in America should have always had equal rights and segregation is immoral. But I was born in the 90’s. I had NOTHING to do with that! And I treat everyone I have ever met with dignity and respect. I have zero hate for black people and I just want to live my life and enjoy it in my country.

8/5/2020,"&gt;Mr. West was until recently a fervent supporter of Mr. Trump and said they shared a “[dragon energy](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/25/kanye-west-donald-trump-dragon-energy),” but he declared early last month that he would run for president himself. A few days later, Mr. Trump [retweeted a post ](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506875-trump-shouldnt-be-hard-for-kanye-west-to-take-away-votes-from-biden)that said Mr. West could siphon votes from Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has clinched the Democratic nomination. “That shouldn’t be hard,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Corrupt Joe has done nothing good for Black people!”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. West developed a relationship with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, after Mr. West’s wife, Kim Kardashian West, worked with the president on criminal justice reform efforts. Mr. Kushner declined to comment, but a person close to him said that while Mr. West had periodically reached out to him, Mr. Kushner hadn’t been stoking a run to divert votes away from Mr. Biden.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be sure, if Mr. West’s goal is to disrupt the general election between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, he is going about it in a strange way. For instance, some of the states where he has filed to get on the ballot have been solidly red states, like Arkansas, where his presence would almost certainly do little to change the general election equation. But other states he is targeting, like Wisconsin, are seen as pivotal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soon after his announcement, [he explained](https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2020/07/08/kanye-west-says-hes-done-with-trump-opens-up-about-white-house-bid-damaging-biden-and-everything-in-between/#7c02799647aa) that he was going to use a Wakanda-like management approach, referring to the fictional country from “Black Panther.” His running mate, Michelle Tidball, is a self-described “[biblical life coach](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/07/kanye-west-vice-president-michelle-tidball)” based in Cody, Wyo., where the Wests have a ranch. Ms. Tidball, [according to TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2020/07/11/kanye-west-vp-michelle-tidball-mental-health-background-audio-bio/), once advocated making beds and doing dishes as a way to treat mental illness.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. West has missed the filing deadlines in a number of states, and on Tuesday he appeared to have [abandoned efforts](https://www.courthousenews.com/kanye-west-withdraws-petition-to-get-on-njs-2020-ballot/) to get on the ballot in New Jersey, but he could still be a spoiler in other states. Mr. Jacoby said he hoped that news media attention underscored the complexity of getting on the ballot and “the need to modernize such ballot access laws to make it easier for every American who wants to serve.  
&gt;  
&gt;”During an appearance in South Carolina last month, Mr. West [broke down crying](https://people.com/politics/kanye-west-first-campaign-rally-south-carolina/). He [later tweeted](https://pagesix.com/2020/07/20/kanye-west-says-kim-kardashian-tried-to-lock-me-up-in-twitter-rant/) that his wife, Ms. Kardashian West, “tried to bring a doctor to lock me up.” Amid his erratic behavior, his wife has [spoken out](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/entertainment/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-mental-health-statement/index.html) about her husband’s struggles with mental illness, and Mr. West has [publicly apologized](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1287128322959237120) to his wife for some of his comments.  
&gt;  
&gt;So with little resemblance to a viable campaign, it is unclear why ballots are still being gathered on Mr. West’s behalf. A spokeswoman for Mr. West referred questions to the campaign, which did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Kardashian family also had no immediate comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump’s staff [aimed to depress turnout](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-voter-suppression.html) [among Black voters](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/trumps-black-voter-dilemma/505586/) after determining that its own appeal to African-Americans was slim. His appeal to Black voters that year was, “What do you have to lose?”  
&gt;  
&gt;A [recent commercial](https://host2.advertisinganalyticsllc.com/admo/viewer/2343047) by the Trump campaign demonstrates that this continues to be part of its strategy. The ad focuses on tough-on-crime legislation supported by Mr. Biden during his Senate career, claiming that “Joe Biden’s policies destroyed millions of Black lives,” while [ads aimed at whites](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/trump-tailors-conflicting-ads-to-blacks-whites-on-biden-record) claim that Democrats are too soft on crime.  
&gt;  
&gt;The strategy of depressing turnout among Black voters has also [been a favorite](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/06/facts-are-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder-says-roger-stone-trump-confidante-in-exclusive-interview/) of Roger Stone, Mr. Trump’s longtime political adviser; Mr. Trump [commuted Mr. Stone’s prison sentence](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html) earlier this year after his conviction on seven felony charges.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Stone, who has maintained his innocence and who has vowed to help the president win re-election, has also previously focused on third-party national candidates, and he helped Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, as a Libertarian Party candidate in the 2012 race.  
&gt;  
&gt;But he said he was not involved in whatever Mr. West was doing.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I really like Kanye West — I like his Christianity, and I like his rejection of identity politics,” Mr. Stone said. But he added that it was “too late to launch either an independent or a third-party candidacy, because more than half the state deadlines have passed” and getting access in the remaining states would be “expensive and difficult.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Stone added that if Mr. West’s efforts were “intended to draw Black votes from Joe Biden, Joe Biden’s own role in the 1994 crime bill,” a hard-line measure, would do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of those who oppose Mr. Trump have been suspicious of Mr. West's candidacy, to say the least. And they have expressed concerns that he could play a role similar to that of Jill Stein, the 2016 Green Party candidate whom many Clinton supporters still see as having siphoned votes away from the Democratic nominee.  
&gt;  
&gt;The political commentator [Ana Navarro-Cárdenas](https://twitter.com/ananavarro) recently tweeted that voters should “pay no attention” to Mr. West and likened him to Ms. Stein, saying such candidates “come in a variety of colors and gender.”",-0.0103

The nation was soon consumed with the impeachment proceedings against Trump over the Ukraine affair. Beneath the din, Pierson and other senior intelligence officials continued to meet and review Russia’s influence campaign, past and present.

They learned as well that **Russia would be focusing its 2020 efforts on the battleground states.** It was during this same period that the N.I.E. was finalized. In early February of this year, Pierson and other intelligence officials gave a classified briefing on prospective election threats to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

2. It suggests that supporting an American business that had nothing to do with the widely described USA warcrimes is morally equal to supporting MBS' personal pet peeve project that is directly harming human rights and that is bordering local genocide.

8/1/2020,"So if you want a long answer, here’s a basic timeline:

- Democrats were super racist, Republicans we’re mildly progressive. Then a Republican in the 60s realized he could get more political power over the southern US by appealing to their blatant sense of racism and ridiculous reliance on a corrupted version of Christianity over legitimate science and fact.

- Presidents Nixon and Reagan would further this “Southern Strategy” during their collective time in office and the Republican Party essentially became the new Democrats, while the progressive politicians escaped to what was left of the Democratic Party. Basically the sides switched and a lot of people failed to notice, which is why you see so many memes where conservatives try to call Democrats the “KKK.” Technically they were at one point, but not in the past 60-70 years.

- Fast forward a bit and the GOP (Republican Party) is losing ground as racism becomes uncool, so they start implementing dog-whistle (coded) language into speeches. This allows for the “right” people to get their message, while other people join the party unaware of the true meaning. Don’t get me wrong, most Republicans are not racist, at least not intentionally. But a very vocal minority are, and the party refuses to do anything about them because they need their votes.

- Trump comes along and bastardizes the GOP even further, being very openly racist, sexist, and all around a shit person AND president. He only won because he empowered all the politicians who were too scared to publicly go against the status quo. So now you have huge movements against LGBT rights, abortion, and even the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” simply because the people on that side are too stuck in their ways to accept that their entire system is wrong.

- Trump’s empowerment also extends to people who believe in Deep State conspiracy theories like Q Anon, who use batshit religious logic trying to claim that not wearing a mask during a global pandemic is a show of their “freedom” instead of a legitimate public health move. They don’t believe doctors, they read Facebook all day and develop severe mental disorders. The worst part is, their attitude influences dumb people on the LEFT like Jake Paul and his fans to get together in large groups and infect each other.

- Speaking of a global pandemic, the Trump administration consistently fails to listen to Anthony Fauci on the matter, instead focusing on banning TikTok and avoiding hot button issues surrounding the rights of every American citizen. This even resulted in Herman Cain, a Black conservative politician who they could point to as a token minority, contracting COVID at a mask-optional Trump rally and dying a couple days ago.

- Now on Election Day, which Trump is trying to postpone, we have to choose between him and Joe Biden. Joe doesn’t seem to be physically fit for the job and does have a history of creepy accusations against him, but at least he’s not Trump. Besides, whoever he picks for a VP will get to shine much brighter, and right now he’s doing his best to choose a female POC for the job. While it feels performative and unnecessary in the current climate, it’s gonna break down a lot of barriers.

Left leaning people I know (including myself) believe in several conspiracies

*the base conspiracies 9/11, JFK, Marilyn Monroe, Aliens, big tech spyware (like chips) 

*That American politics is rigged (see every leftist ever in disbelief that joe won over Bernie) 

*Things like government spending basically to benefit that politicians themselves, China and Russia colluding to take the US down, The government working to divide people. 

* that gentrification and inequality exist, that manifestation exist, that the world actually ended in 2012

* that our government and the Chinese government both have concentration camps (see uighurs and ice detention) 

* that trump is a dictator and his followers exhibit cult like behavior. 

* that celebrities are pretty much trash peddling perfection that isn’t obtainable (which is why platforms like YouTube and Tiktok have blown up) because it’s more authentic than instagram and television and movies. 

* that America is slowly but surely becoming a police state (martial law) 

*that all organized religion is just a way of brainwashing people into obedience out of fear their god will deny them access to some bullshit fairyland.

Biden, on the other hand, goes between saying he didn't write the bill (after claiming he did in the 90's), and saying it didn't lead to more incarceration, even though it included provisions for mandatory minimum sentencing. One might also mention that in 1986 he voted for the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which codified a huge disparity in mandatory minimum sentencing for powdered vs crack cocaine (to target poor communities), continuing a clearly racist policy that an aide in the [Nixon Administration admitted to](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/index.html). 

Biden likes to claim credit for things that happened when he was VP. I think it's only fair that he does that he accepts blame for many of the terrible policies as well. 

&gt; That's not a winning strategy for the Democratic primary electorate, which mostly thinks very highly of the Obama administration. 

Was 2016 a winning strategy? A lot of people were fed up enough with everything to put *Trump* in office. And the Obama administration is at least partially responsible for that because the recovery from the 2008 crisis was so lopsided after he gave up on a number of issues he campaigned on. I'd argue Trump was elected because the Democratic party isn't willing to be self critical or reflect on the impact of their policies. 

A lot of policies that Trump is rightly criticized for are extensions of policies from other presidents, including Obama. The main difference is that Trump is more open, blatant about the horrible policies and doesn't put a veneer of niceness on them (and don't get me wrong, he is also worse on some policies). 

Regarding Ukraine: It's not quite as simple a story as you suggest. There is evidence suggesting US involvement ... which is hypocritical given the Russiagate hysteria over the past 4 years that has been thrown around without any concrete evidence.

August 2, 2019 - [Online conspiracy theories like QAnon and Pizzagate are 'domestic terrorism threats', says FBI ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/02/online-conspiracy-theories-like-qanon-pizzagate-domestic-terrorism/)

Article in OP: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889kgp/terrorism-experts-say-qanon-conspiracy-theory-a-threat-to-national-security

&gt;Qanon  is going mainstream and that’s bad. More than bad, it might be a  national security risk. That’s the conclusion of a new report from West  Point’s Combating Terrorism Center (CTC) on [the emergence of the conspiracy theory into daily life](https://ctc.usma.edu/the-qanon-conspiracy-theory-a-security-threat-in-the-making/). *The QAnon Conspiracy Theory: A Security Threat in the Making* clearly explains what QAnon is, its roots in American history, and how and why some of its adherents turn violent.

&gt;The CTC is an academic institute within West Point [focused on studying terrorism and ideology](https://ctc.usma.edu/about/) through research. [Amaranth Amarasingam](https://amarnathamarasingam.academia.edu/), a professor of religion at Queen’s University, and [Marc-André Argentino](http://www.concordia.ca/sgs/public-scholars/profiles/marc-andre-argentino.html),  a PhD Candidate at Concordia University, co-authored the paper, which  breaks down the threat posed by QAnon and clear and simple terms.  “Though less organized than jihadi or far-right extremists...QAnon  represents a novel challenge to public security,” the paper said.

&gt;QAnon  can be confusing for the outside observer. It’s like the greatest hits  of American conspiracy theories from the past 50 years, supercharged,  and turned into a vast online roleplaying game. It’s hard to articulate  what adherents believe and why those beliefs lead to violence. It has no  central leader and encourages its followers to do their own research. 

&gt;“QAnon  is thus markedly different from other far-right extremist groups and  jihadi groups,” the paper said. “As it lacks both a clear organizational  structure and a centralization of interpretive duties.”

&gt;Broadly,  QAnon followers believe President Trump is waging a war against a  shadowy cabal of entrenched politicians who traffic children for occult  and sexual purposes. It sounds strange and novel, but as the West Point  paper points out, it’s a repackaged version of old conspiracy theories. 

&gt;“QAnon  also represents a militant and anti-establishment ideology rooted in an  apocalyptic desire to destroy the existing, corrupt world to usher in a  promised golden age,” it said. “This position finds resonance with  other far-right extremist movements, such as the various militant,  anti-government, white nationalist, and neo-Nazi extremist organizations  across the United States.”

&gt;That’s  one of the things that makes QAnon so viral—it’s a one size fits all  conspiracy theory, compatible with existing belief structures. “QAnon  followers share roots with con-spiracy theories that have fed other  anti-government movements, such as the 90s militias that feared the ‘New  World Order,’ or the anti-government apocalypticism and religious  fervor of the Branch Davidians,” the paper said.

&gt;Argentino and Amarasingam cited five examples of QAnon leading to real world violence. The most recent is Jessica Prim, [a woman arrested in April with dozens of illegal knives in NYC](https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-qanon-devotee-live-streamed-her-trip-to-ny-to-take-out-joe-biden).  “She also livestreamed this two-day trip from Illinois to New York City  and in it threatened to kill Joe Biden for his supposed involvement in a  ‘deep state’ sex trafficking ring, in line with QAnon narratives,” the  paper said.

&gt;Argentino  and Amarasingam poured over Prim’s social media activity and built a  map of her radicalization. “What stands out with this case is the  rapidity with which Prim apparently radicalized to violence,” they said.  “From her first contact with QAnon propaganda, apparently on April 9,  2020...20 days passed until she made threats of offline violence while  in transit to New York City.”

&gt;Argentino and Amarasingam said it’s possible this will get worse as the movement gets bigger. There are currently [more than 60 Congressional candidates who’ve expressed sympathy for QAnon](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/qanon-ballot-november-on-the-media).  “With this mainstreaming, as well as the impending presidential  election that seems likely to only increase QAnon’s salience, an  increasing frequency of criminal or violent acts by QAnon supporters  seems possible, even likely,” they said.

&gt;QAnon  is indicative of how misinformation spreads online and how damaging it  can be, but it’s just one example. It’s also not clear that  deplatforming or regulation will work to stop the spread. As Amarasingam  has pointed out before, [deplatforming ISIS on Telegram gave the group something to fight for](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb55bd/telegram-deplatforming-isis-has-given-them-something-to-fight-for?). 

&gt;“Regulation  of QAnon content could simply result in platform migration and further  reinforce QAnon’s cosmology that sees a cabal of pedophiles lurking  behind every corporate or gov-ernmental decision,” the paper said.

&gt;The big takeaway from the West Point paper is that QAnon isn’t going away and that the violence might get worse. 

&gt;“Based  on the authors’ observation of QAnon activity on Telegram, there is a  growing overlap between QAnon channels and more extremist channels  affiliated with the proud boys, paramilitary groups, and white  supremacists,” they said. “QAnon is arguably no longer simply a fringe  conspiracy theory but an ideology that has demonstrated its capacity to  radicalize to violence individuals at an alarming speed.”",-0.0074

You’re way wrong on this one. I was in Portland when this was all happening, people a few blocks away from me were detained without being read rights, had no warrant, and showed no proof that they were an officer of the law. I wasn’t told this, I was there. 



Lol, imagine defending putting children in jail. What a sad little world you live in where you believe that is a good thing. Just because their parents have violated the law doesn’t mean they should be held in prison, which by the way has no legal standing.

Oh but Fox News? Surely nothing biased or fake about that outlet, and it’s the source he gets all his information from- his advisors have explicitly stated he watches Fox News daily. Every media has a bias, but to call it illegitimate while praising a completely biased source is pure projection and a propaganda tool. 


I’m saying he’s far more guilty of suppressing elections than Joe Biden (which he claims is happening and that the democrats are interfering in the election) except everyone knows that if everyone came out to vote then the republicans would be slaughtered - so why suppress anyone? 


You are out of your GOD DAMN MIND if you think our bastard in chief isn’t being protected by the senate, if there was no senate majority his ass would be gone. You don’t understand how the bicameral impeachment process works - the dude is quite guilty but the senate decided not to show the unredacted Mueller report in the impeachment hearings and the republican majority prevented any witnesses from testifying - dozens of people were ready to do so. Just saying that “they lied about all that stuff” is a bullshit argument. There was no trial, it was a sham. 



Bruh you have no substance to any of your counter points and you think I’m just disagreeing with him, the Republican Party and you because I don’t like y’all?

2. He really has been bad when it's come to the Pandemic. There have been a small number of good move (War Powers Act for ventilators, for example), but as a whole he's said and done some insanely stupid things. The drinking bleach thing still makes me cringe.

3. The other major candidate is Joe Biden. He is on record dozens of times saying he's proud that he was the one who helped militarize the police, and that he's so proud he's responsible for their extremely aggressive tactics. 

So, if people are stuck in the mindset they need to vote for one of those two, who do they go for? A complete idiot, or the guy who weaponized the police against the Black community?

Biden is likely to serve only four years should he win, clearing the way for his VP to run in 2024.

So other than obvious people like Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini or Idi Amin? I guess I can go through a list of all the most terrible people and list them. None of them are vaguely realistic.

So maybe James Buchanan is the answer.

I know some Never Trump Republican people who could answer this question. They were going to vote for any Democrat as long as it wasn’t Bernie Sanders or a member of the Squad.

8/8/2020,"&gt; Almost every attempt at reform has failed miserably. The culture is rotten to the core. This is not an opinion, but a statement of fact.

When your garden is blighted, you should look to the gardener for the cause. The police are a tool, employed to undertake a task too unpleasant for many people to stomach. They have a job to do and this job is to enforce laws that are written by the people you elect to represent you. 

The police culture is defined by the people who enter the police force. More people should be willing to take up that responsibility if you want that culture to change. If you think police reform is impossible and ACAB then who will you replace them with? Are you willing to step up? Your black-and-white mentality may find itself challenged if you actually have to pick up the shit yourself. 

Community policing has fallen by the wayside, as a direct result of policies political leaders -- like Joe Biden, fun example -- wrote and ran to office on. You are blaming the hounds for the master siccing them upon you.

He is actually responsible for a lot of grabbing at a federal level throughout his career. 

Everyone seems to forget--we have 3 branches of government, our President no matter who is in there is generally a week leader comparatively. They have 8 years tops and they're out. They also can be hamstrung by the SCOTUS and Congress. One thing I think we need to vote Trump in is because we need that SCOTUS seat. There are currently about 10 cases awaiting SCOTUS decision. They are waiting to take them? Why do you think that is. If they wait until after the election and Trump wins. RVG dies or retires. Then they have a new red SCOTUS appointee. 6-3 red. If Biden wins they're in the exact same spot they are now.

As far as your question on society:

\\-Every election year, the protests are getting bigger, more extreme, more violent. They seem to be getting worse. In 2012 you had Occupy. In 2016 you had BLM and fuck Trump, Walk for Life, and the pink hat one. In 2020 you had George Floydd and Portland. Its trending in the wrong direction....

\\-The defund/abolish the police initiative is going to grow larger. I've from Michigan. We saw this after 68--it will cause white flight and many of these cities to be Detroit 2.0. This will further the urban/rural divide.

\\-Partisan media and social media and echochambers are hindering constructive discussion and people are becoming more divided.

\\-If you look at a voting map. Every major city pretty much is blue. Every rural area is red.

\\-Some far left states have a very large amount of people advocating burning down the constitution and starting over. A lot of people are leaving this areas. This tells me we are headed towards balkanization.

\\-I've been through the liberally indoctrinated education system. Socialism = good. Capitalism = bad. Nationalism = bad. Fuck america = good. This is only going to get worse.

Same old game, same old goal: keep people divided.

Is the Republican Party doing anything to help those black businesses, or just using them as a way to disparage black protesters? Just wondering.

Please. This is doomed shit. This shit is gonna last 4 years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris sucks ass and couldn’t even make it to a primary. Once again, conditions are worse than they were under Bill Clinton and these are not the singular personalities that came out in the form of Clinton and Obama. Biden is the first time that the Democrats might actually manage to get one of their mediocre picks across the finish line for the first time ever. You really think that Joe Biden’s administration is really going to produce a singular personality like Clinton or Obama? He’s gonna pick dipshits like Rahm Emmanuel, Eric Garcetti and the Klob to run his administration. These people are personality vacuums and the rest of the Democratic backbench in cities and states is red with blood from their handling of the George Floyd protests and COVID-19.

Yes Democrats are the better bet for cannabis legislation but they do not have the right answer either.   The bare minimum Is what will happen. This isn’t a republican or Democrat issue.

Joe was one of the top promoters among the Democrats.

Also, all of Congress and all of the American people didn't support America's war of aggression against Iraq.  There were a few members of Congress who had the integrity and courage to say no, along with millions of other Americans who were vehemently against the invasion from the outset.

It's both deeply disappointing and pathetically shameful that so many Democrats excuse the members of their party in Congress who gave the green light to the American equivalent of the Nazi invasion Poland.

Tracking so far Your Wokeness? At this point disagree and we can discuss my claim above with statistics if you disagree.

Let’s assume you don’t disagree and I’ll proceed.

Being at the bottom wrung of every quality of life stat isn’t tied to ethnicity, nor is it tied to some claim of police brutality, but it is tied directly to poverty.

Living in poverty isn’t tied to ethnicity. You’re racist if you assume all black people are poor.

The two strongest predictors of living in poverty are growing up in a single parent household and not graduating high school.

The black population in the US as a population are the highest group who live in a single family households and have the lowest high school graduation rates.

Now, the aim of Black Lives Matter is to stop police brutality as you stated. Does police brutality cause low graduation rates or women to have kids out of wedlock? I’ve not seen a convincing argument that it does. Correct me if you have some data, Your Wokeness.

From what I’ve seen is white liberals distracting attention from root causes to score some woke points on social media.

The best thing white people can do is get out of the way and let black leadership organically arise if they feel that what needs to happen. 

Anything else is just noise. Don’t forget that Democrats were the Confederacy. Don’t forget that Joe Biden as a senator pushed hard and enacted tough federal sentencing for having crack vs coke.

I talk to people in my sphere (family, friends, fellow members of my church, etc.) all the time about it and most of them eventually relent that they too have some misgivings about his character, but they’re ultimately fine with it because he’s on their side. 

I cannot tell you how much that answer has turned me off. 

I said to my father last week, “You have been complaining about Clinton corruption for the past 25 years. If corruption no longer matters, then what was that all about?”

He had no real answer. 

He basically shrugged his shoulders and said, “They were way worse.”  Then, he walked away — because he understands that his decision to condemn one set of corruption but completely forgive and excuse the other set of corruption is just total nonsense and counter to everything he has taught me to believe. 

That’s why it’s so disappointing and why I take it so personally. I’m seeing really good people going against their own deeply held convictions I know they hold and it’s just sickening to see. 

I told my dad to end our conversation the other day that I am not a big Joe Biden guy but I will definitely be voting for him in November and I’ll also be voting against the GOP in most of the down ballot races too because iview Trumpism as a cancer on America that must be excised, not excused. 

I could see that he was obviously disappointed in what I had to say but I think he also respected my convictions.  He just told me he loved me and he walked away and we haven’t spoken since.  I’m sure we will speak after everyone cools down but my opinion is never going to change in that regard and it’s clear that neither is his.

So although I disagree with what you have said I still respect it I rather you not talk negative about Joe Biden and the reason being is because if there's someone that's on the fence with who to vote for whether it's Biden or drumpf and that person happens to read what you say that is if it's negative it might just push that person to the other side and that's the only reason I have problems with Democrats or actually anyone that's going to vote for Joe Biden talking shit about someone they're going to vote for.

**Article**:

&gt; A new poll indicates that a plurality of American voters have a positive opinion of Sen. Kamala Harris, who made history on Tuesday as the first Black woman to serve as a major political party’s vice-presidential pick.

&gt; A Georgetown University/Battleground national poll released on Monday – one day before presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named the senator from California and former state attorney general as his running mate – showed that 43% of likely voters nationwide had a favorable view of Harris, with 36% holding an unfavorable view. Eight percent said they had no opinion and 13% answered that they’ve never heard of the senator.

&gt; BIDEN CHOOSES HARRIS, ONCE A HARSH CRITIC, AS HIS RUNNING MATE

&gt; Harris’ favorable rating was up in Georgetown University polling from last October, when she stood at 35% favorable and 43% unfavorable. At the time, 7% had no opinion and 16% hadn’t heard of the senator. The earlier poll was conducted as Harris’ Democratic presidential campaign was running short on cash and her numbers in the nomination horse race were in decline. The senator suspended her White House bid two months later, in December.

&gt; According to the new poll – which was conducted Aug. 1-6 – Harris has a 76% favorable rating among Democrats. But she’s slightly underwater among independent voters at 37%-40% -- and she has a 10%-65% favorable/unfavorable rating among Republican voters.

&gt; Harris had a 64%-15% favorable rating among Black voters, 41%-39% among White voters, and 39%-32% among Hispanic and Latino voters.

&gt; TRUMP CAMPAIGN QUICKLY BLASTS HARRIS AS &amp;apos;PHONY 

&gt; “I think she energizes a base that’s already pretty energized,” Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University&amp;apos;s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, said.

&gt; “Her numbers are incredibly high with African American voters, with people who don’t like President Trump, with a lot of the key constituencies of the Democratic base,” added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

&gt; The Georgetown University Battleground poll was conducted by Lake Research Partners and the Tarrance Group, with live telephone operators interviewing 1,000 likely voters. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

So the scenario I'm posing to you is that Joe Biden goes about hurting a group that you or other Republicans presumably like and Joe Biden dislikes. The point of this exercise is to figure out where you draw the line.

To convey this point I have to make several changes but legally you have conceded the circumstances are the same or that you are unwilling or unable to distinguish them. If you so wish we can change the scenario to convey the same messages but better match up with what is happening in real life?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It should be noted that the only significant public figure expressing public concern over the prospect of Trump postponing the election is Joe Biden. Not even Hillary Clinton is that paranoid:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Mark my words: This is sheer idiocy, and anyone propagating it is either an idiot or someone pandering to idiots. Maybe the media should ask Biden to clarify to which of these categories he belongs.

&gt; The article assumes Trump wouldn't attempt to postpone the election because he knows congress would stop that. Turns out Trump was overestimated.

I reflexively voted for the republican candidates in 2016, including Trump, and I deeply regret it now.

This year, I got deeply sucked into reading and informing myself about the spread of the coronavirus when it started in Asia. Trump did one bad thing after the next, crippling our response and confusing the public. This resulted  in a country divided when it should have been united against the virus. It all got my attention and enraged me. Finally, I saw the petty and selfish things Trump has been doing. The pandemic has really shown everyone's true colors.

Then George Floyd was murdered and peaceful protests were met with more brutality. Trump encouraged the violence and orchestrated a brutal unconstitutional clearing of peaceful protesters to get a photo op... That was the last straw. I started to look into Joe Biden.

I'm no Biden supporter, and never paid much attention to him. I also heard rumors of his negatives: old, creepy, senile, and makes tons of gaffes. Compare this to what damage Trump has done in the last 6 months, I'll take the creepy, rambling grandpa!

Now, I do think that most of the stuff Trump says is just for show, like when he complains about China and how we should buy American, a perfect example was that stupid USELESS “buy american” week he did, it’s all stupid symbolism and show, btw Biden just beat Trump at his own game with his Build Back Better agenda he announced and Trump hates it lmao.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/08/05/us/connor-betts-dayton-shooting-profile/index.html

I’d label this as a lone wolf influenced by social media and overtaken with the antifa ideology.

I’d label the Dayton shooter as extremist Antifa, just as I’d label those lone wolves who kill in the name of Allah as extremist Muslims.

I doubt under his leadership we will be less dependent on foreign labor. I have no confidence in his ability to bring together a divided nation.

8/3/2020,"Trumpism may be as bad as fascism, but I do not see it as the same thing.  Fascism was a movement with maximalist ideological principles.  Trumpism is not coherent enough to be the same thing. It puts corth a different malevolence.  Trump’s main ideological beliefs center around the promotion of himself, Donald Trump.  Trump’s attendance span is not long enough to “get the trains to run on time.”  Trump says the most outrageous things partly out of calculation and partly out of his stream-of-conscious way of communicating, while other interests operate in the background so businesses can loot the Treasury.  

I am not saying there is a difference to be pedantic.   I am saying this because there is a functional difference that may lead to different outcomes.  They won’t be good for sure, but it cannot be thought of entirely the same as other fascist countries.

Fascism is a  maximalist political movement.  It seeks for the state to do everything.  If Trumpism was coherent, Trump would have helped develop a better response to the pandemic out of naked self-interest.  He could on his way to an easy reelection considering his strong base.  Trump instead gave authority to state governments so Trump could blame them for failures and take credit for any successes.  There was no centralized response.  So Trump is currently losing to the Democrats, a political party which offers no meaningful resistance running a remarkably weak and incoherent candidate in Joe Biden.

(Mods please don’t fucking ban me I’m a neoliberal and I just browse a lot of different subs)

**EDIT:** I found the “info” I was talking about:

&gt; In 2005, James Biden purchased an acre of land on Water Island for $150,000, quickly secured an easement, and divided it into three roughly equal parcels.

&gt; Just a year later he sold one to Green and his wife for $150,000 in what appears to be a nice deal for the Bidens, who retained control of two-thirds of the property. Subsequent tax bills put the assessed value of Green’s parcel at around $38,000 until that number jumped to $83,700 in 2013.

&gt; Biden later went to Green for a loan on the property instead of the traditional route, a mortgage loan from a bank. Neither Green nor Biden have developed their parcels, though it’s not clear why.",-0.0004

8/8/2020,"&gt;Donald Trump’s 2000 presidential platform was way tougher than this bill. 

So, to be clear, on a policy level Biden devastated the black community, while Trump only proposed it.

And unlike [Trump](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/500888-trump-biden-set-back-black-americans-big-time-with-crime-bill), Biden [still expresses support for the racist mass incarceration Biden Crime Bill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsK3aaYq9zA)

**But muh 2000 platform**. Yes, as it turns out, the orange man has had nearly four years for racist police policy, and he still hasn't even come close to implementing the racist police policy that Biden did. You know, basically the exact police polices that BLM is protesting: mass incarceration, profiling of the black community, police brutality, increased police numbers, increased police militarization, etc. 

 &gt;Donald Trump tear gassed peaceful protestors for a photo op. 

Yeah, that was dumb.

&gt;Donald Trump lied and said a question about the disparity of people killed by police between black and white Americans was a nasty question, and white people were killed more. 

Yes, we both know that Trump has said racist things about the black community (so has Biden ^^[1](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/06/joe-biden-latino-african-american-remark-392354), ^^[2](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/508948-charlamagne-tha-god-rips-biden-shut-the-eff-up-forever), ^^[3](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-racial-jungle-quote/), while Biden has had a far more detrimental impact on the black community on a policy level.

In realtà il professor Lichtman, a differenza del polpo dei mondiali del 2010, non usa l’istinto per indicare il futuro vincitore ma il sistema delle 13 chiavi, ossia 13 domande a cui rispondere solo con un ‘sì’ o con un ‘no’, e che riguardano la società, l’economia, il lavoro, la stabilità sociale. In base a queste tredici risposte secche è possibile comprendere se l’amministrazione (nel senso di partito, non di Presidente) sarà confermata o se si avrà un cambio. Il sistema, che fin qui non ha mai sbagliato, prescinde da statistiche, sondaggi e desideri ed è dunque considerato molto attendibile, viene sfoderato ogni quattro anni e, per il 2020, ha sentenziato: Joe Biden",-0.8000

They’re both clowns, and the worst part is it’s working because we’re too hopeless and enamoured with the spectacle of it to do anything about it. Sad",-0.3611

*Both before and after the election. After I won, they continued spying.*

*About that - now, we have to see what's happening.*

The reason she refuses to do this is so that Bone Spurs' Nazi posse will continue to tear up the country, thus keeping people scared and angry thus \\*forcing\\* them to vote for Joe The Rapist Biden. Because without that pressure people would wake up and realise they don't have to settle for that pile of shit. Never let a crisis go to waste, eh Nancy?

I'm writing in Bernie, I don't care what Bernie wants. I'm sick of all the collaborators.

Biden is just as evil,  the DNC are Vichy collaborators, and fascism is molting and discarding the elites who got them where they are.

7/29/2020,"This solidifies it in my mind that the DNC intends to lose.

7/31/2020,"Em novo recuo do governo Trump, agentes federais vão se retirar de Portland, cidade há dois meses cenário de [violenta repressão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/maes-formam-grupos-para-evitar-que-tropas-enviadas-por-trump-ataquem-manifestantes.shtml) a protestos raciais. Sob um acordo com a governadora democrata do Oregon, Kate Brown, os agentes começam a sair da cidade na quinta-feira (30).

 Os protestos que começaram após o [assassinato do homem negro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/familia-de-floyd-processa-cidade-de-minneapolis-e-policiais-envolvidos-em-morte.shtml) George Floyd em Minneapolis, em maio, recuperaram intensidade no país, com ajuda de um torcedor: Donald Trump.

 A nova onda de protestos foi encorajada pelo presidente que despenca nas pesquisas, não quer e não sabe [gerir a pior pandemia do século](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/trump-muda-discurso-recomenda-mascaras-e-diz-que-pandemia-vai-piorar-antes-de-melhorar.shtml) e não conta mais com uma economia para usar como vitrine na campanha de reeleição.

 Encurralado e cercado de sicofantas que o protegem da realidade, Trump decidiu que o terrorismo racial é a alternativa para mobilizar eleitores brancos em novembro.

 Começou espalhando uma mentira em linguagem de código racial, alertando que seu rival, o democrata Joe Biden, “acabaria com os subúrbios” se eleito. A acusação não tinha nada de sutil. É uma referência à origem dos subúrbios americanos no século 20: vastamente brancos e inacessíveis a proprietários de minorias raciais.

  Como o imaginário do presidente estacionou na segunda metade do século passado, quando seu pai esbravejou insultos contra a chegada dos primeiros italianos ao bairro do Queens, onde foi criado, ele não percebeu que o perfil demográfico suburbano hoje é outro.

 Na quarta-feira (29), Trump escancarou e tuitou avisando aos que vivem seu “Sonho de Estilo de Vida Suburbano” não devem se preocupar com desvalorização de suas casas porque ele rescindiu uma lei criada por Barack Obama contra a discriminação imobiliária. Assim, o “crime vai cair,” prometeu.

  

 

Os protestos que marcaram o mês de junho, além de quase sempre pacíficos, eram e continuam multirraciais. [Pesquisas mostram Trump perdendo apoio na sua base predominantemente branca](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/graficos-explicam-tamanho-da-vantagem-de-biden-sobre-trump-na-corrida-presidencial.shtml), especialmente entre mulheres.

 E veio a solução da crise manufaturada. Usando os ataques a monumentos de figuras do lado perdedor da sangrenta história racial americana, Trump fez seu Departamento de Justiça montar em Portland, no estado do Oregon, um teste de marketing de campanha.

 As reações à [aparição de agentes federais armados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/forcas-federais-deixarao-portland-a-partir-de-5a-diz-governadora-do-oregon.shtml), em uniformes de camuflagem, sem identificação, jogando manifestantes em carros igualmente não identificados foram lentas, talvez pela incredulidade.

 A mídia americana fora da bolha trumpista demorou a colocar a intervenção federal em Portland no lugar certo, nas manchetes.

 E a mídia controlada pelo nefasto bilionário australiano Rupert Murdoch deixou clara a cumplicidade com o que é uma forma inconstitucional de policiamento urbano em manchetes como a do tabloide nova-iorquino New York Post: “Cidades democratas explodem em noite de violência através da América”.

 A hipocrisia do secretário de Justiça, William Barr, que se comporta como advogado pessoal do presidente e auxiliar da campanha de reeleição, foi exposta na terça-feira (28) num confronto entre ele e a deputada democrata Pramila Jayapal durante uma [audiência na Câmara](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/secretario-de-justica-defende-acao-federal-contra-ativistas-mas-nega-querer-ajudar-trump.shtml).

 Jayapal cobrou do secretário o fato de ele não achar necessário intervir em Michigan, quando manifestantes armados e exibindo suásticas [bloquearam acesso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/grupos-fazem-protestos-contra-a-quarentena-em-estados-dos-eua.shtml) à Assembleia Legislativa do estado e pediram o linchamento da governadora, a democrata Gretchen Whitmer, por ter imposto uma quarentena durante a pandemia.​

She could actually become a hero if she exposed them all and said she was the victim...which she obviously is on some sad level. No socialite wants to end up with a pedo after he dad commits suicide for fraud.  And she was dumped by that pedo and hired as his personal aid. That's just pathetic.

Now what we do have to worry about is trump fucking witness tampering and letting her go before she even has a chance to feel pressure.  He has already said too much to her.  Preparing the fake cover story and all this wishing a fucking pedo bitch well crap.  Jesus fucking Christ this guy is unbelievable.  I'm amazed every day that some lunatic hasn't killed him :-/",-0.2713
7/31/2020,"You said he supports Trump over Biden, saying Biden is an idiot doesn't make someone a Trump supporter. Do I have to break everything down for you that I said and repeat what you said? I'm saying that if he isn't a politician then who fucking cares what he says. An obsession with Trump like you have isn't healthy. You're the one taking everything out of context, Joe didn't just say \hey I'm voting for Trump\"" someone asked him if he was forced to vote for either one he would pick Trump but he would vote for Tulsi or Bernie if he had a choice. That's twisting words""",-0.2711

Now yes, Trump does have facepalm moments, and it's fine if you disagree with him, but the hate for him on that subreddit is abhorrent.

8/4/2020,I'll preface this with a huge TRUMP SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT! Joe Biden is evil. The dude wrote the Patriot Act that created Homeland Security and a vast unchecked spy network that currently spies on every single American. Joe Biden is an evil dude and it's a damn shame that the two party system makes him our only option to stop the other evil dude.,-0.2696

8/4/2020,"&gt; South Carolina
&gt; President
&gt; 
&gt; Donald Trump (R-inc.) — 49% (+5)
&gt; 
&gt; Joe Biden (D) — 44%


I'm sorry, *what*?

I know everyone's focusing on the Senate numbers because of how disappointing Graham has been, but the Presidential numbers are... not good, to say the least.

The smallest margin in the last 20 years was in '08, and McCain still carried SC by 9 points. If Trump can't crack 50% and there's only 5 points between him and Biden, this is landslide-level bad. I'm hesitant to use the L-word, but seriously, this isn't an isolated case: he's polling badly in Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, even *Texas*; not to mention the Rust Belt, which is slipping away from him every single day.

As for the Senate: if Harrison can keep these numbers steady till October, it might be an actual race, who would have thought?",-0.2683
7/25/2020,"Sorry, you thought that a gotcha?

Joe Biden sucks and is suffering from cognitive deterioration just like Big Daddy Trump. They're both racist and garbage.

What's your counterpoint?",-0.2667
7/27/2020,"No, they're really not. Presidential polls don't care about your opinions. They care about who you're going to vote for. Joe Biden doesn't give a shit why I'm going to vote for him. His campaign doesn't care what my opinion is. They care if they've got my vote. The variables you're talking about are irrelevant to them, like hair color.",-0.2667
7/26/2020,"I am in 100% agreement with you. I too, hate Biden.

8/3/2020,"I think everybody understands this by now. Nobody is voting *for* Joe Biden, nobody is stupid enough to believe he even knows what day it is. They're only voting *against* Trump.",-0.2667
8/4/2020,Joe Biden isn’t a war criminal. Isn’t a rapist or sex offender. OP is a liar. Where’s the outrage for making false claims against men? OP is the same as that Karen meme that says men should just accept being accused of rape even if they didn’t do it.,-0.2667

7/27/2020,"The criminal, thief, ‘illegal’ immigrant, the homeless person- are not our enemies. 

These are symptoms of a society that has broken down, a system that was not equipped to deal with these problems- instead we label all of these ‘problems’ our ‘enemies’ without going to the root of the problem.

Why? Because people in power and positions of authority in this system have no incentive on giving up their status and doing something different. They would rather blame others, and create boogeymen to distract from the root causes of these issues- as they have no intention of changing and potentially giving up their position of power and authority.

So we will just keep kicking the can down the road, and watch as these problems get worse. Maybe a few small changes here and there, but nothing too dramatic.

I’m looking at you Joe Biden and establishment Democrats.",-0.2631

8/7/2020,"Every issue with Biden, I would say is equally bad with Trump. Have you watched his various interviews? Is he on his 20 thousandth lie or 30?Besides, I’m more concerned with the people they will be surrounding themselves with. With any luck, Biden will be elected and die. Trump, on the other hand, continuously pushes our allies away and alienated our country from the world. If he is re-elected, it will show everyone that his four years were not a fluke. In addition, Trump “the law and order candidate” undermines our democracy by doing whatever he wants because he knows nobody can stop him. Even now, he plans to blatantly disregard the Hatch Act  (which he is immune to but his base and employees are not) by accepting the RNC nomination on the White House South Lawn.

There is no logic or reason behind his actions because he is *sick*.  Look at his Twitter right now....he's going on about beating Joe Biden.

It's the language, the quick snap of anger, the overstepping of bounds and continuing when the child is saying that she is uncomfortable and him stepping in to let them know that not only is it going to happen, but that they need to get used to it anyway, the exploitation of a position of power... all of it. The man is a groomer. I don't give a fuck if you like Trump or not, he has nothing to do with this. Joe Biden is a sick fuck. Open your damn eyes.",-0.2619

How do you plan on winning the rust belt with Joe Biden and Kamala Fucking Harris? Are they seriously this out of touch with reality?

You: possibly a Republican plant?",-0.2617
8/3/2020,"Have you heard of #Blexit?  Lol.  Biden is racist.  He said he didn't want his kids growing up in a jungle.  Support segregation.

Even the left knows Biden is a racist https://www.leftvoice.org/joe-biden-is-a-racist-who-loves-police-brutality  They picked the WORST option of them all with Biden.

For that matter, I don’t care about what anyone outside of Joe Biden thinks Joe Biden will do, regardless of political party or who they are.

I care about what Joe Biden said he will do, which is decidedly anti-gun. I care about the history of what Democrats have done, which has been decidedly anti-gun.

I don't need proof that he is a racist, or that he is senile.  He's proven that himself multiple times; also, it is truly disgusting how you liberals apologize for his behavior.  I really don't know how you live with yourselves.

&gt;Trump is responsible for thousands upon thousands of deaths from his lack of action for the pandemic. 

I remember when Trump said he wanted to ban traveleirs from China coming into this country Democrats called him a racist.  As for action wiothin states, that's up to governors, not Trump.

&gt;Plus all the worst shit you have to say about Biden is a lot easier to prove for Trump, and they wouldn't even be the worse you could say about him.

If Hunter Biden did not represent Burisma in an issue before the US government and if Joe Biden did not act on behalf of Burisma then what make it corrupt?

Joe Biden acted in accordance with US policy, supported by GOP senators like Ron Johnson, our foreign allies and the World Bank, to encourage Ukraine's government reforms in removing a corrupt prosecutor who was well known for taking bribes from companies like Burisma in exchange for protection. Burisma is corrupt, Victor Shokin was corrupt, heavily tied to Russians (who do not favor Ukrainian independence) and in the pocket of Burisma - refusing to prosecute their corruption.

Hunter Biden exercised poor judgement taking a position with a corrupt company (a drug addict taking advantage of an opportunity to earn big $$ - such a suprise). Joe Biden exercised poor judgement in not stepping aside from his role in Ukraine during that time period.

But, poor judgement is not necessarily corrupt, though it gives the appearance of such.

What act or decision was made differently as a result of Hunter Biden's position and relationship with the VP? 

And, if your answer was the removal of Victor Shokin as Prosecutor General, please cite the news sources of people who were upset by that because the [U.S. Senate Ukraine Caucus, including GOP Senators Portman and Johnson were also urging Poroshenko to get rid of Shokin](https://www.portman.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/portman-durbin-shaheen-and-senate-ukraine-caucus-reaffirm-commitment-help).

Clearly China and Russia are at odds, but the question is why? The main reason I can see is that Trump seems to let Russia do whatever they want (see: election interference and bounties), but also to an extent lets China but pretends to care (e.g., making TikTok an issue while it is not an issue at all, but ignoring the Uighur work camps and continually expanding authoritarianism of Xi Jinping).",-0.2100

Sadly true

After the 2016 debacle, you would think the DNC would learn. You thought selecting literally the worst and only candidate that could possibly lose to Trump was a wake up call. But no, somehow someway, they found the one single candidate in all of the USA that is literally worse than Hillary was. 

Stupid part is that he may still win. That's how bad Trump is and how bad the nation is doing. You know they are going to use Biden winning as an indication of their good judgment. That's infuriating. 

Think of this angle. The DNC has not run one proper campaign since the 70's. They are so bad they make the Republicans look like political geniuses.

* Carter's re-election was foiled by Ted Kennedy. 
* Mondale and Dukakis ran jokes of campaigns. 
* Bill Clinton won only because of Perot. 
* Bill got re-elected because of the booming economy he had nothing to do with.
* Gore ran literally the worse campaign imaginable against a clown Bush Jr
* Kerry should have easily defeated Bush, but had incompetent advisors
* Obama won because he brought in his own staff and actually originally pissed off the DNC
* Obama got re-elected because of stable growing economy, unfortunately he dismissed his entire campaign staff
* Hillary lost because of all the reasons we know. She was the worst candidate ever and also ran a terrible campaign.

8/5/2020,"I wouldn’t care at this point. It doesn’t feel like a democracy or even a republic for me anymore at least. Everything feels predetermined and I’ll never really have representation. With election day coming I feel like a soviet citizen being asked to just check the one box available. The outcome won’t change, it’ll just make Fox and CNN switch from offense to defense again. If i vote for anyone or no one I’m a bad person, if it isn’t Joe Biden. But I don’t want to say I support him. I don’t want him to have a vote which will be misconstrued as support for him and his policies. So yeah, I guess it’d be like adding another Thanksgiving?",-0.1750
8/6/2020,politician worship. You can practically see the dude's prion Alzheimer brains falling out of his ears in grey wet clumps. you don't have to pretend to be stoked on Joe Biden because he is a shit candidate who is obviously suffering from severe mental degradation. his fucking license should be suspended. I'm begging yall to raise your bar on who's dick to suck.,-0.1750
8/6/2020,It’s the absolute truth. Bernie Sanders actually wanted to help people and the democrats all screwed him. Joe Biden is an awful candidate and offers us nothing,-0.1750
8/6/2020,Or maybe soros has finally figured out how to kill America. Put up an unimaginably bad candidate in joe Biden. Then stockpiling bricks and bats in key locations in preparation for the inevitable lose. Cue riots and blame trump for all of it.,-0.1750

8/8/2020,"&gt; Trump is now claiming that voting for Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'.

I still don't understand why Biden 'hurting God' is bad for him according to a Trump voter.  You're telling me that if covid turns into the literal Apocalypse, Joe Biden can *beat up God* and end it?  If that's true we should make Joe a permanent guardian.",-0.1750
8/9/2020,"Weird. When I search BabeyloneBee about Trump dementia jokes I find nothing. I don't even find normal Trump jokes.

But I did find 10+ jokes about Biden and dementia.

Here is another one.

I just don’t want politics to be so charged every day, I don’t need to be outraged by Trump or outraged by the reactions of far-left assholes in exchange.

7/28/2020,"&gt;	you do support trump

No, I don’t. As I previously said, I think he’s a moron unfit for office and is making the US look really bad. 

Despite that, I have a little thing called nuance that so many of you dummies lack. 

Imagine there was a murderer that was caught and all over the news. Then, imagine it comes out that he also stole candy from kids. Despite that, I think the evidence is lacking and that there’s no reason to believe he’s guilty of stealing from kids, and I make that opinion known. Am I a murder-sympathizer for trying to discredit false rumors? Am I a child theft sympathizer for denying those allegations? No, because the murder aspect has nothing to do with my argument.  My argument, simply and concisely, is that he’s not, in fact, guilty of stealing from kids. 

Your argument is so brittle and weak that you have to deflect to not only making up assumptions about my political views (that I have denied multiple times) but also calling me a white nationalist sympathizer. 

I see absolutely no evidence of legislative actions that hurt black communities. I _also_ see no distinct rhetoric that clearly indicates his beliefs as so. Further, actions speak much louder than words. Joe biden once said “black kids _can_ be as smart as white kids” in an obvious non malicious mistake. It would be stupid to label him as a racist for a comment that wasn’t truly what he meant. But idiots like you eat that shit up.",-0.1749
8/9/2020,"Joe Biden has said some really dumb things about how black people voting for trump aren't really black.

It's always nice to see that the 2 major options for the US presidency both are terrible people who have no grounding in society.",-0.1743
